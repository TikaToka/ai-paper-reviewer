### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

This research investigates how different training methods affect which layers of a vision model are essential for its function.  They use various training techniques (adversarial training, self-supervised learning, improved training recipes, different augmentations) on ResNet-50 models trained on ImageNet. They measure layer importance by resetting parameters to random values and checking the impact on the model's prediction accuracy.  They find that the training method profoundly affects which layers are critical; Improved training methods make early layers more crucial, whereas adversarial training increases the importance of deeper layers. The findings also suggest a correlation between model complexity and generalization performance, though not a direct causal one.

Brighter spots are auxiliary, i.e., resetting these layers does not significantly affect the model.
