### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

This research explores how different training methods affect the way neural networks use their various layers.  They discovered that not all layers are equally important for making predictions. Some layers can even be replaced with random values without significantly affecting the accuracy of the model, indicating a level of redundancy. Their experiments involved training various ImageNet classification models using different methods: improved training, self-supervised learning, augmentations, and adversarial training.  They found that methods like improved training and self-supervised learning tend to make the earlier layers of the network more important, while techniques such as adversarial training increase the importance of deeper layers.  The paper suggests that understanding these dynamics is key to improving network efficiency and developing better-performing models.  The study provides a new way to analyze the inner workings of these complex models, giving researchers insight into how different training approaches shape the functionality of each network component.

Brighter spots are auxiliary, i.e., resetting these layers does not significantly affect the model. We denote the average (meanÂ±std) layer criticality for both, a model across layers on the right, for a layer across model on the bottom.
