Stage 1 cultivates fundamental abilities using diverse datasets covering GUI understanding (element recognition and layout comprehension), question answering, instruction grounding, general knowledge, and tool usage. Stage 2 introduces native advanced reasoning, employed during both training and inference. This stage follows a cyclical process at each step, consisting of Reflection, Hierarchical Reasoning (strategic and tactical layers), Action, and Expectation. Each step receives the overall task, the history of previous screenshots and reasoning, and the current environment as input. Reflection assesses the previous action\u2019s outcome against its expectation, while Expectation predicts the outcome of the current action for subsequent reflection.", "description": "\uadf8\ub9bc 1\uc740 InfiGUIAgent\uc758 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. 1\ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec GUI \uc774\ud574(\uc694\uc18c \uc778\uc2dd \ubc0f \ub808\uc774\uc544\uc6c3 \uc774\ud574), \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5, \uba85\ub839\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5, \uc77c\ubc18 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud0a4\uc6c1\ub2c8\ub2e4. 2\ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uace0\uae09 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub294 \ubc18\uc131, \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ucd94\ub860(\uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ubc0f \uc804\uc220\uc801 \uacc4\uce35), \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uae30\ub300\uc758 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \uc791\uc5c5, \uc774\uc804 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9b0\uc0f7 \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860 \uae30\ub85d, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud604\uc7ac \ud658\uacbd \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc785\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\uc131 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\uc804 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uae30\ub300\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uace0, \uae30\ub300 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc74c \ubc18\uc131 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.04575/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Case of GUI Understanding.", "description": "\uadf8\ub9bc 2\ub294 GUI \uc774\ud574 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uc0ac\ub840\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc548\ub4dc\ub85c\uc774\ub4dc \uae30\uae30\uc758 \uc124\uc815 \uba54\ub274 \ud654\uba74\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9b0\uc0f7\uacfc \ud568\uaed8, \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc694\uc18c\ub4e4(\uc608: \ub4a4\ub85c\uac00\uae30 \ud654\uc0b4\ud45c, \uc124\uc815 \uc81c\ubaa9, \uac01 \uc124\uc815 \ubc94\uc8fc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac04\ub7b5\ud55c \uc124\uba85\uacfc \uc544\uc774\ucf58)\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.
