[{"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2412.16926/x1.png", "caption": "Figure 1: Results of various sample selection approaches in many-shot ICL with LCLMs. Approaches include Retrieval that selects examples similar to the target query, Diversity that aims for maximizing example variety, Curriculum that arranges examples in order from easiest to hardest, and Hard that uses only challenging examples, alongside Random that selects examples without any constraints. Results indicate that sample selection methods provide no significant improvement over the naive (random) approach and sometimes perform worse. Meanwhile, Augmentation refers to the approach that generates additional demonstrations and uses them along with original samples for ICL, for low-resource tasks (such as translation, reasoning, and classification) that do not contain enough samples to utilize the full capacity of LCLMs, showing substantial performance gains.", "description": "\ubcf8 \uadf8\ub9bc\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c \uc120\ud0dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uc7a5\ubb38 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LCLM)\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2dc\ub3c4 \uc0c1\ud669 \ub0b4 \ud559\uc2b5(ICL) \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.
