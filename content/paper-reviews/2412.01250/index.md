### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current embodied instance navigation tasks assume users provide complete descriptions before navigation starts. This is unrealistic; real-world instructions are often brief and ambiguous.  This paper introduces Collaborative Instance Navigation (COIN), where agents interact dynamically with users during navigation to clarify ambiguities. This requires addressing when and how to interact effectively.

The paper proposes a novel method, AIUTA, which uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for self-dialogue to refine object descriptions and reduce uncertainties.  An Interaction Trigger module decides when to ask clarifying questions from the user, minimizing interaction. The authors introduce CoIN-Bench, a benchmark with real and simulated users, to evaluate AIUTA's performance and demonstrate its efficiency in minimizing user input.

> üîº This figure illustrates the Collaborative Instance Navigation (COIN) task and the AIUTA method.  A user requests to find a picture. The AIUTA-equipped agent navigates an unknown environment, interacting with the user only when necessary through open-ended dialogue. The agent uses two modules: a Self-Questioner (which uses an LLM and a VLM in a self-dialogue to refine object descriptions) and an Interaction Trigger (which decides whether to ask the user a question, continue navigation, or stop). The figure shows the agent's path (1-5) with blue boxes showing the Self-Questioner and Interaction Trigger outputs at each step. The right side details the inner workings of the modules.

> Figure 1:  A sketched episode of the proposed Collaborative Instance Navigation (CoIN) task. The human user (bottom left) provides a request (‚ÄúFind the picture‚Äù) in natural language. The agent has to locate the object within a completely unknown environment, interacting with the user only when needed via template-free, open-ended natural-language dialogue. Our method, Agent-user Interaction with UncerTainty Awareness¬†(AIUTA), addresses this challenging task, minimizing user interactions by equipping the agent with two modules:¬†a Self-Questioner and an Interaction Trigger, whose output is shown in the blue boxes along the agent‚Äôs path (‚ë† to ‚ë§), and whose inner working is shown on the right. The Self-Questioner leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Language Model (VLM) in a self-dialogue to initially describe the agent‚Äôs observation, and then extract additional relevant details, with a novel entropy-based technique to reduce hallucinations and inaccuracies, producing a refined¬†detection description. The Interaction Trigger uses this refined description to decide whether to pose a question to the user (‚ë†,‚ë¢,‚ë£), continue the navigation (‚ë°) or halt the exploration (‚ë§).

### In-depth insights


#### CoIN Task Intro
The Collaborative Instance Navigation (CoIN) task introduces a novel, more realistic approach to embodied instance navigation by emphasizing **dynamic human-agent interaction**. Unlike traditional methods that assume complete initial descriptions, CoIN allows for minimal user input, such as simply specifying the object category. The agent actively engages in a **template-free, open-ended dialogue** with the user to clarify ambiguities and resolve uncertainties as needed during navigation. This requires the agent to not only perceive its surroundings but also to **intelligently determine when and what to ask the user**.  This design better reflects real-world scenarios where detailed upfront instructions might be impractical. The CoIN task thus challenges existing methods to move beyond relying on exhaustive initial information and to adapt to the nuances of collaborative interaction in dynamic environments.

#### AIUTA Method
The AIUTA method, presented in the context of Collaborative Instance Navigation (COIN), is a novel training-free approach that significantly reduces the need for explicit user input during embodied AI tasks.  **It leverages a synergistic interplay between a Vision Language Model (VLM) and a Large Language Model (LLM)** to achieve this. The VLM provides initial visual perception, while the LLM refines this perception through a self-dialogue process, generating questions to clarify ambiguities and reduce hallucinations. This refined description is then used by an interaction trigger to determine if further user interaction is necessary, minimizing user input while maintaining high accuracy.  **The AIUTA method's core strength lies in its capacity to handle uncertainty inherent in VLM outputs.** A novel entropy-based technique quantifies this uncertainty, allowing the system to filter out unreliable details, resulting in a more robust and accurate representation of the scene. **The combination of self-dialogue, uncertainty quantification, and a strategic interaction trigger forms the innovative core of the AIUTA method, making it a highly effective approach for collaborative instance navigation tasks.**

#### CoIN-Bench Eval
A hypothetical 'CoIN-Bench Eval' section would deeply analyze the proposed Collaborative Instance Navigation (CoIN) benchmark's effectiveness.  It would likely present results comparing the proposed AIUTA method against existing state-of-the-art object navigation techniques. **Key metrics** would include success rate, path efficiency, and crucially, the number of user interactions required.  The evaluation would likely encompass both simulated and real human user studies, **highlighting the strengths and limitations** of each approach in handling varying levels of user input. Simulated users allow for scalable, repeatable experiments, while real users provide a more realistic measure of usability and robustness.  **A detailed breakdown of performance** across different task difficulty levels (e.g., varying number of distractor objects) and user input types (e.g., minimal vs. detailed instructions) would be essential, demonstrating the true practical value and limitations of CoIN in real-world scenarios.  The results would need to show AIUTA's **flexibility** in minimizing user input while maintaining high performance. Finally, **ablation studies** would assess the impact of individual components of AIUTA, revealing which aspects are most crucial for success.

#### VLM Uncertainty
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are powerful tools, but their susceptibility to hallucinations and inaccuracies poses a significant challenge in applications like instance navigation.  The concept of "VLM Uncertainty" directly addresses this, focusing on quantifying and mitigating the unreliability of VLM outputs.  This is crucial because **blindly trusting VLM outputs can lead to significant errors in downstream tasks.** The paper explores this issue in the context of collaborative instance navigation where the agent relies on the VLM's perception of the environment.  The authors propose a novel entropy-based technique to estimate VLM uncertainty, which helps identify and filter unreliable or hallucinated information. This **uncertainty estimation is not just a simple yes/no answer but a nuanced probabilistic assessment**, allowing the agent to make informed decisions about whether to trust the VLM's perception or seek clarification from a human user.  The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments, showcasing its importance in improving the robustness and reliability of VLM-powered systems. The approach is shown to greatly improve the accuracy of the overall system, while maintaining efficiency by reducing the number of interactions with the human user.

#### Future Works
Future work in collaborative instance navigation should prioritize **reducing reliance on large language models (LLMs)** due to their computational cost and potential privacy issues.  Research could focus on **developing more efficient, lightweight models** suitable for onboard processing in robots.  **Improving the robustness of vision-language models (VLMs)** to reduce inaccuracies and hallucinations is crucial. This could involve developing novel uncertainty estimation techniques or exploring alternative architectures.  **Expanding the CoIN-Bench dataset** with diverse environments and object categories would further enhance the generalizability and reliability of future collaborative navigation systems.  Finally, exploring more sophisticated techniques for **agent-user interaction**, moving beyond simple question-answer pairs towards more nuanced and context-aware dialogues, would significantly improve the user experience and overall efficiency of the system.

> üîº Figure 2 illustrates the AIUTA method's workflow.  The left side shows the interaction between the AIUTA agent and a human user.  The agent receives an initial instruction (1), such as 'Find the picture.' At each timestep (2), a zero-shot policy, incorporating an object detection module, selects an action. Upon detecting a potential target object (3), AIUTA is activated. The agent uses a VLM to get an initial scene description (4), which is then refined by a Self-Questioner module using an LLM to generate attribute-specific questions for the VLM (4). This process reduces uncertainty, leading to a refined description (S<sub>refined</sub>). The Interaction Trigger module (5) then compares this refined description to known facts to decide whether to stop navigation (6), because the target object is found, or to ask the user a question (7) to obtain more information, updating the known facts (8). The right side of the figure provides a detailed breakdown of the AIUTA architecture and its components.
