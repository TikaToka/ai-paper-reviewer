### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) based on Transformers are computationally expensive.  This paper introduces Router-Tuning, a method that dynamically adjusts the computational depth of the model by selectively skipping layers deemed less important.  This is achieved via a lightweight 'router' network. Traditionally, these methods require retraining the entire model which is costly and time-consuming; this new approach only fine-tunes the router, drastically reducing costs. To address potential performance issues of skipping important layers, the researchers propose MindSkip, which employs attention mechanisms with dynamic depths, ensuring important information is still processed. Experiments across multiple LLMs demonstrate a 21% speed increase and a minimal performance drop (0.2%). The approach focuses on efficiently skipping attention layers, as those are the most computationally intensive layers in the transformer architecture, avoiding the performance degradation observed when skipping other layers such as MLP layers. Router-Tuning and MindSkip offer a novel and computationally inexpensive method for optimizing LLM performance, making it more practical for deployment.
