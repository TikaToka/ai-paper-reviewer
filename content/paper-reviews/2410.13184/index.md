### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) based on Transformers often use fixed computational resources for each input token, leading to inefficiency.  Mixture of Depths (MoD) aims to solve this by dynamically skipping less important layers.  However, existing MoD methods are expensive to train and risk performance degradation. This paper introduces Router-Tuning, which fine-tunes only a small router network (less than 0.01% of parameters), significantly reducing training costs.  To mitigate performance drops from layer skipping, it proposes MindSkip, applying dynamic depth selectively to attention layers.  Experiments demonstrate that Router-Tuning with MindSkip achieves a 21% speedup with only a 0.2% performance drop in various LLMs, such as Llama and Mistral.  This is achieved by selectively skipping layers and fine-tuning a minimal component (the router) rather than training the entire model. This approach is significantly faster than other methods, and shows effectiveness across multiple large language models.  The code has been released publicly for reproducibility.
