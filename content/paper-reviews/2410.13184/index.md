### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) based on Transformers are computationally expensive.  This paper tackles this issue by introducing two techniques: Router-Tuning and MindSkip. Router-Tuning reduces training costs by only fine-tuning a small, lightweight router network instead of the entire model.  This router decides which layers to skip during processing. MindSkip enhances efficiency by selectively skipping less important layers within the Transformer's attention mechanism (the part responsible for understanding relationships between words). Experiments show that this method, when applied to attention layers, achieves a 21% speed-up in inference time with minimal loss in accuracy (only 0.2%).  Testing across different LLMs shows consistent benefits. The approach is significantly faster and cheaper to train than prior methods using Mixture of Depths (MoD). This work provides valuable insights into improving both the training and running efficiency of LLMs without sacrificing much accuracy.

#### Why does it matter?
This paper is important because it introduces a novel method for making transformer models more efficient.  It addresses the high computational cost of large language models, a significant challenge in the field. The techniques proposed, particularly Router-Tuning and MindSkip, offer practical solutions to improve the efficiency of existing models and can inspire future research into more efficient model architectures and training methods.
