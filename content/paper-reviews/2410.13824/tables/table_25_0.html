The chapel stands tall with its intricate stone architecture, large pointed windows, and spires reaching towards a sky filled with textured clouds, dramatically lit by the moon. The moonlight and artificial lighting create a serene yet slightly eerie ambiance. The foreground is dominated by a grassy field and trees, which frame the structure and add to the overall picturesque and timeless feel of the scene.</td></tr></table>
