[Response]: Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require hu- man intelligence, such as learning, problem- solving, and decision-making. AI systems use algorithms and data to analyze and interpret in- formation, allowing them to make predictions, classify objects, and generate insights. They can be trained on large datasets to improve their performance over time, and can even adapt to new situations and learn from experience. AI has many applications, including robotics, nat- ural language processing, image recognition, and expert systems, and is increasingly being used in industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation.</td></tr><tr><td>[Instruction]: Can you write a script for a public service announcement about the importance of recycling?
