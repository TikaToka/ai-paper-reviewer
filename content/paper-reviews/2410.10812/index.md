### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

The research introduces HART, a new method for generating images that combines the best aspects of two existing methods.  These older methods are autoregressive models and diffusion models. Autoregressive models work by building up an image piece-by-piece like a sentence, while diffusion models work by refining a noisy image into a clear picture. HART combines aspects of both: it uses a hybrid approach to tokenization, combining discrete and continuous representations, leading to better image reconstruction. Then it uses both autoregressive and diffusion components, resulting in faster generation and better image quality. Experiments showed HART could generate images as good as the top diffusion models, but much faster. This makes high-quality image generation more efficient, opening up new possibilities for research.

#### Why does it matter?
This paper is highly significant for researchers in computer vision and machine learning.  It introduces a novel hybrid autoregressive model that bridges the gap between autoregressive and diffusion models, offering a compelling alternative for image generation tasks. The improved efficiency and comparable image quality to diffusion models could greatly advance research in areas like text-to-image synthesis, image editing, and efficient large-scale visual generation. The hybrid approach also opens up interesting avenues for further exploring the synergy between discrete and continuous latent representations.
