### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

The research introduces HART, a new autoregressive model for generating high-quality images.  Unlike previous models, HART uses a 'hybrid tokenizer' that combines discrete and continuous representations of image data. This allows it to capture both the overall structure and fine details of images more effectively.  Furthermore, HART incorporates 'residual diffusion,' a lightweight technique that enhances the quality of the generated images.  The results show that HART matches or exceeds the image quality of the best diffusion models but is considerably faster, achieving up to 7.7 times higher throughput and 5.9 times lower latency. This makes HART a promising alternative for applications where speed and efficiency are crucial.

#### Why does it matter?
This paper is highly important for researchers in visual generation due to its introduction of HART, a novel autoregressive model that rivals diffusion models in image quality while significantly improving efficiency.  This efficiency gain is critical, enabling applications previously infeasible due to computational constraints.  The hybrid tokenizer and residual diffusion approach offer new avenues for exploring the balance between accuracy and speed in visual AI, influencing future autoregressive model designs.
