### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

AutoTrain is a new open-source tool designed to make training advanced machine learning models significantly easier.  It's designed to be used without needing to write complex code, so researchers and practitioners of all skill levels can use it.  It handles a variety of different tasks, from training large language models and working with images to dealing with tabular data. This makes it very versatile.  The tool aims to solve common problems with model training, such as figuring out the best settings (hyperparameter tuning), making sure the models work well on unseen data (validation), and efficiently training models on large datasets using multiple computers at the same time (distributed training). It also includes tools for monitoring training progress to avoid issues.  The authors provide a user-friendly interface, both graphical and command-line, so it's easy to use.  They also demonstrate its ease of use by showing how to finetune a large language model, a very computationally intensive task.
