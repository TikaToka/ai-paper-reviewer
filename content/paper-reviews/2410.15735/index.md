### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

AutoTrain is a new open-source tool designed to make it easier to train advanced machine learning models, even without extensive coding experience.  It provides a simple, user-friendly interface that handles many of the complex aspects of model training, such as choosing the right settings, dealing with large datasets, and monitoring the training process.  It works with a wide variety of models and tasks, including natural language processing, computer vision, and tabular data. The goal is to make advanced AI techniques more accessible to a broader range of users, including researchers and practitioners who may not be expert programmers.  The paper demonstrates AutoTrain's capabilities and discusses its potential benefits for AI development.  It also mentions some limitations and future work, such as addressing challenges with model ensembling and sample weighting.
