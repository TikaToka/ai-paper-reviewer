### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current large multimodal model (LMM) evaluation methods for video analysis rely heavily on traditional benchmarks using multiple-choice questions.  These methods often fail to capture the nuances of real-world user interaction and are expensive and time-consuming. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a new evaluation method.

The proposed method, VideoAutoArena, uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate human users, generating open-ended and adaptive questions. It incorporates an automated judging system and a fault-driven evolution strategy to enhance scalability and rigor. The results demonstrate that VideoAutoArena effectively differentiates among state-of-the-art LMMs and aligns well with human judgment, offering a cost-effective and scalable evaluation framework.

### In-depth insights


#### Auto Arena Eval
An 'Auto Arena Eval' system for evaluating large multimodal models (LMMs) in video analysis would necessitate a robust and scalable infrastructure.  **Automated user simulation** is crucial to generate diverse and realistic queries, mimicking real-world user interaction with video content. This requires sophisticated techniques like persona generation and context-aware question formulation. **A pairwise comparison approach** (peer battles) allows for relative ranking of LMMs, reducing the need for absolute scoring which is often subjective.  The system should incorporate **automatic judging** mechanisms that align with human preferences, possibly through a combination of rule-based and machine learning methods. **Fault-driven evolution**, where question difficulty increases based on LMM performance, ensures continuous improvement and rigorous evaluation.  The effectiveness of the 'Auto Arena Eval' system hinges on the accuracy of its automated components and their ability to capture the nuances of human judgment.  **Benchmarking against human evaluation** provides a crucial validation step, quantifying the level of alignment and identifying areas for improvement.

#### User Sim LMMs
Employing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for user simulation in evaluating video analysis capabilities presents a significant advancement.  **User Sim LMMs** offer a scalable alternative to expensive and time-consuming human annotation, a crucial limitation of traditional methods. By simulating diverse user personas and their associated question-asking styles, User Sim LMMs create a more realistic and comprehensive evaluation benchmark. This approach allows for a deeper understanding of model strengths and weaknesses in handling complex, real-world video analysis tasks.  The **automated nature** of User Sim LMMs facilitates continuous and efficient model comparison, allowing for dynamic ranking and iterative model improvement.  However, challenges remain in ensuring the realism and diversity of simulated users, as well as in developing robust and unbiased automated judging systems. The **future** development of User Sim LMMs will depend on progress in LLM capabilities, specifically in natural language generation and nuanced user persona modeling.

#### Fault-Driven Evol
The concept of "Fault-Driven Evol" suggests an iterative process of improving a system, specifically an AI model for video analysis, by focusing on its weaknesses.  It implies that the system isn't just evaluated passively; rather, **its shortcomings are actively analyzed to generate increasingly complex and challenging questions**. This approach goes beyond traditional benchmarking by dynamically adapting the evaluation to push the model's boundaries. This iterative refinement, driven by identified faults, is crucial for **achieving robust and generalizable performance**. The method's effectiveness stems from the use of a feedback loop where the model's deficiencies inform the creation of more difficult scenarios, ensuring it is constantly tested and improved in user-centric ways. This is a **significant departure from static benchmark tests** and more closely resembles real-world usage, where the challenges and types of questions are rarely constant.  The ultimate goal is to develop more resilient and sophisticated models able to handle the unpredictable nature of actual user interactions and diverse video analysis tasks.

#### ELO Ranking Sys
An ELO ranking system, when applied to a multimodal model evaluation arena like the one described, provides a robust and dynamic mechanism for comparing model performance.  **Its strength lies in its continuous and adaptive nature**, allowing for a fluid recalibration of model rankings as new comparisons are made. This contrasts with static benchmarks that offer only a snapshot in time.  The system's reliance on pairwise comparisons, simulating real-world user interactions, makes the rankings more meaningful and reflective of actual user preference.  **The use of an ELO system allows for a fair comparison even if models have not competed against each other directly**.  However, it is important to acknowledge potential limitations, such as the system's sensitivity to the initial ratings and the potential for biases in the questions used to generate the comparisons. To mitigate these limitations, the research may utilize various techniques, such as incorporating a large number of battles and employing methods to minimize stylistic bias and improve question selection.  **The key benefit remains the system's ability to provide a continuously updated and relative ranking** across multiple models, highlighting strengths and weaknesses in a dynamic and user-centric evaluation framework.

#### Benchmark Limits
The heading 'Benchmark Limits' prompts a critical examination of current video analysis benchmarks.  A thoughtful analysis would explore their inherent constraints, such as the **reliance on multiple-choice questions**, which may not fully capture the nuances of real-world user interactions.  The **limited scope of current benchmarks** and the **lack of user-centric evaluation** also need to be addressed, which would highlight the need for benchmarks that evaluate a model‚Äôs ability to handle complex, open-ended questions in diverse contexts.  An ideal benchmark would emphasize **scalability and cost-effectiveness**, as well as its ability to **accurately assess various aspects of model performance**.  Investigating these limitations is key to developing more comprehensive and realistic evaluations for large multimodal models, ultimately advancing the field of video analysis.

> üîº This table presents the results of the VideoAutoArena benchmark, which automatically evaluates large multimodal models (LMMs) in video analysis.  It shows the overall ELO rating for each of the 11 models tested, reflecting their relative performance across multiple video lengths.  Win rates are also provided for four distinct video duration ranges (8-15s, 15-60s, 180-600s, 900-3600s).  The ELO ratings represent a continuous comparison across multiple models and video lengths, facilitating a dynamic and fair assessment of LMM video analysis capabilities.

> üîº This table presents the results of a benchmark called VideoAutoBench.  VideoAutoBench uses human annotations from a subset of battles (model comparisons) in VideoAutoArena to create a gold standard.  GPT-40, a large language model, is then used as an automatic judge to compare the model's answers against these human-selected answers (correct responses) and human-rejected answers (incorrect responses). The table shows how well each model performs compared to these human judgments, providing a streamlined and cost-effective evaluation method for large multimodal models (LMMs) in video analysis.
