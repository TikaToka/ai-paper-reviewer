Each question-answer pair from the PubMedQA dataset undergoes the following steps to generate a hallucinated answer: (1) Candidate Generation: Given a question, relevant knowledge, and ground truth answer, the LLM is prompted to generate a hallucinated answer adhering to one of four hallucination types. (2) Grading & Filtering: Generated answers undergo quality and correctness checks, being labeled as hard, medium, easy, or failed based on filtering results. (3) Refining Failed Generation: Failed answers are optimized using TextGrad\u00a0Yuksekgonul et\u00a0al. (2024) and re-filtered. If they fail again, the LLM is re-prompted to generate new answers (Regeneration). (4) Fallback: If no qualified answers emerge after four regeneration attempts, the answer most similar to the ground truth is selected as an easy hallucinated example.
