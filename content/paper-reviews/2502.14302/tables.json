Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant. | Mitochondria regulate the formation of perforations in lace plant leaves through the modulation of calcium channels and by activating specific proteases that degrade cellular structures, facilitating the PCD process. | Medium |\n| Differentiation of nonalcoholic from alcoholic steatohepatitis: are routine laboratory markers useful? | Misinterpretation of #Question# | Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy. | Routine laboratory markers, particularly mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and AST/ALT ratios, significantly aid in differentiating various types of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). | Hard |\n| Amblyopia: is visual loss permanent? | Incomplete Information | Older people with a history of amblyopia who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the improvement appears to be sustained. | Visual loss due to amblyopia is permanent unless treated with early intervention during childhood. | Hard |", "caption": "Table 7: List of pre-trained models with their huggingface names used in our experiments.", "description": "\uc774 \ud45c\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc758 \ubaa9\ub85d\uacfc \ud574\ub2f9 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc758 \ud5c8\uae45\ud398\uc774\uc2a4(Hugging Face) \uc774\ub984\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ubd80\ubd84\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ube44\uad50 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uac01 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc774\ub984\uacfc \ud5c8\uae45\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc811\uadfc \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uace0\uc720 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc790\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \uc7ac\ud604\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "section": "4 Implementation Details"}, {"content": "| Question: | Prognosis of well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma\u2013is well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma clinically early cancer? |\n|---|---| \n| Ground Truth Answer: | W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs. |\n| Cluster 1 (Fooling) |  1. W-d HCCs are indeed clinically early cancer, due to their smaller size and lower incidence of fibrous capsule formation. \n2. W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated to be early cancer due to their smaller tumor size and lower incidence of fibrous capsule formation. \n3. Well-differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma is indeed early cancer, due to its slow growth rate. \n4. Well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma is clinically early cancer due to its low aggressive nature. \n5. Well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma appears to be clinically early cancer due to its low aggressiveness. |\n| Cluster 2 (That didn\u2019t fool) | 1. Well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is clinically early cancer due to its high histological grade. \n2. Due to its high histological grade, well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is considered clinically early cancer. |\n| Cluster 3 (Fooling) | 1. Well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma is indeed an early cancer, as it often lacks fibrous capsule formation. \n2. Well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are clinically early cancers due to their low incidence of fibrous capsule formation. |", "caption": "Table 8: Medhallu data generated by Gemma2-9B-it (1,000 samples of pqa_labeled).
