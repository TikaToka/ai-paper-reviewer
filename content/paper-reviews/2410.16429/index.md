### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

The research introduces Pantograph, a novel tool designed to improve machine-assisted theorem proving.  Pantograph acts as a bridge between the Lean 4 proof assistant and machine learning models, making it easier to combine the strengths of both approaches.  It offers a user-friendly interface, supporting powerful search algorithms and advanced reasoning steps.  Importantly, Pantograph simplifies the extraction of valuable training data, accelerating progress in automated theorem proving. The paper also demonstrates Pantograph's effectiveness through an illustrative use case involving machine learning models and proof sketches to solve Lean 4 theorems.  This work addresses challenges in creating better interfaces between proof assistants and machine learning systems, pushing the boundaries of automated reasoning.
