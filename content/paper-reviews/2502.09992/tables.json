A block length smaller than the answer length indicates the use of the semi-autoregressive remasking strategy; otherwise, it is not applied. The shorter answer lengths for MMLU and HellaSwag result from their requirement to generate only a single token (i.e., A, B, C, or D) and two special end tokens (i.e., end of the model response and end of the sentence).", "description": "\ud45c 8\uc740 LLaDA 8B Instruct \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c low-confidence remasking \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube14\ub85d \uae38\uc774\uac00 \ub2f5\ubcc0 \uae38\uc774\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc9e7\uc73c\uba74 semi-autoregressive remasking \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\ub807\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.
