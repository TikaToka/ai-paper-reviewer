### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Mobile video editing using diffusion models offers great potential, but existing methods are computationally expensive, hindering their use on mobile devices.  This limitation arises from the complex model architectures, iterative denoising processes, and the computational overhead of classifier-free guidance. The challenge lies in making these methods efficient enough for resource-constrained mobile environments. 



This paper introduces MoViE, addressing these challenges by employing several optimizations. The authors optimized the model's architecture by using a lightweight autoencoder, incorporated a multimodal guidance distillation technique to speed up classifier-free guidance, and introduced a novel adversarial distillation scheme to reduce the number of sampling steps to one. These combined optimizations enable video editing at 12 frames per second on a mobile phone, demonstrating a significant improvement in computational efficiency and on-device feasibility.

### In-depth insights


#### Mobile Diffusion
The concept of "Mobile Diffusion" in the context of video editing represents a significant advancement. It tackles the challenge of computationally expensive diffusion models by optimizing them for mobile devices. This involves several key strategies: **architectual optimizations** of the underlying neural network to reduce computational cost; **distillation techniques** to compress the model's knowledge into a smaller, faster version; and **reducing the number of sampling steps** required for generating edited video frames. The resulting model achieves real-time or near real-time video editing capabilities on mobile hardware, which is a major leap toward making sophisticated AI-powered video editing accessible to a broader audience.  This advancement is **crucial for democratizing access to high-quality video editing**, particularly in scenarios with limited computational resources or power constraints.  The emphasis on speed and efficiency does not come at the expense of quality; the paper demonstrates **high-quality results** comparable to those of larger models running on powerful hardware. Furthermore, the successful implementation on mobile phones signifies **a potential breakthrough in on-device AI applications** and paves the way for more computationally intensive tasks to be performed effectively on resource-constrained devices.

#### Multimodal Distillation
Multimodal distillation, in the context of diffusion models for video editing, presents a significant advancement by tackling the computational bottleneck of classifier-free guidance.  **Instead of multiple forward passes for each diffusion step (one for each modality and one unconditional), multimodal distillation cleverly incorporates guidance scales directly into the model's architecture.** This allows the network to simultaneously consider image and text instructions within a single forward pass, dramatically reducing inference time and computational cost.  The core innovation lies in **efficiently distilling the knowledge embedded within multiple guidance scales into a single, unified representation**, improving both speed and controllability.  This technique is **crucial for deploying computationally expensive video editing models on resource-constrained mobile devices**, enabling real-time or near real-time performance where previously infeasible. The effectiveness of multimodal distillation highlights the potential of knowledge distillation in making sophisticated generative models more accessible and practical across various hardware platforms.

#### Adversarial Training
Adversarial training, in the context of generative models like diffusion models, is a powerful technique used to improve the model's robustness and quality.  It works by pitting a generative model (the student) against a discriminative model (the discriminator). The student attempts to generate outputs that fool the discriminator into believing they are real data, while the discriminator strives to distinguish between real and generated data. This creates a competitive environment, forcing the generator to produce increasingly realistic and high-quality outputs.  **A key advantage is its ability to enhance generalization**; by training the model on adversarial examples ‚Äì inputs designed to confuse the model ‚Äì it learns to be more robust to unseen data and less susceptible to noise or perturbations.  However, **a major challenge is the computational cost**.  Adversarial training often requires significantly more computational resources than standard training.  Moreover, **finding the right balance between quality and efficiency is crucial**.  An overly aggressive adversarial training process can lead to overfitting or decreased image quality.  Successfully implementing adversarial training often requires careful tuning of hyperparameters, careful selection of the discriminator architecture, and a well-defined training strategy to maintain both efficiency and performance.

#### On-Device Efficiency
On-device efficiency in video editing is a significant challenge due to the high computational demands of diffusion models.  **The paper tackles this by introducing a series of optimizations to reduce the computational cost and improve the speed of the video editing process.** These optimizations include using a lightweight autoencoder, and classifier-free guidance distillation to speed up the process significantly.  **A key innovation is their novel adversarial distillation scheme to reduce sampling steps from ten to one while preserving quality and controllability.** The results demonstrate a remarkable improvement in on-device performance, achieving 12 frames per second on a mobile phone. This is a substantial achievement, moving towards real-time video editing on mobile devices, and highlighting **the significant potential for diffusion-based methods in practical, resource-constrained settings.**

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore several promising avenues.  **Improving the efficiency of the autoencoder** is crucial; a more lightweight model would further accelerate the process. Investigating **alternative diffusion model architectures** optimized for mobile devices, potentially exploring less computationally expensive alternatives to UNets, warrants attention.  **Expanding the range of editing capabilities** by incorporating more sophisticated editing functionalities, such as object manipulation or complex temporal effects, while preserving efficiency, is another significant area.  **Addressing the limitations in handling long videos** remains important. The current approach's linear scaling with video length could be improved for better efficiency.  **Enhancing the robustness and generalization** of the model across diverse video types and quality levels would be valuable, as would exploration of **different training strategies** to further optimize model performance and speed on mobile platforms. Finally, research focusing on **reducing the memory footprint** of the entire pipeline would enable editing of higher-resolution and longer videos on resource-constrained devices.

> üîº Figure 2 illustrates the computational efficiency improvement achieved through multimodal guidance distillation. The standard classifier-free guidance pipeline (left) uses two input conditionings (image and text), requiring three inference runs per diffusion step due to separate calculations for text-only, image-only, and combined image and text conditionings.  In contrast, the distilled pipeline (right) integrates guidance scales (sI and sT) directly into the UNet, thereby requiring only one inference run per diffusion step.

> üîº This figure illustrates the adversarial distillation process used to train a single-step video editing model.  A multi-step teacher model is used to generate a sequence of increasingly less noisy video frames (denoising process). At each step, synthetic noisy frames are created and fed to the student model along with guidance signals (controlling image and text edits). The discriminator distinguishes between real (from the teacher) and synthetic (from the student) frames, training the student to generate realistic edits. Importantly, guidance scales (controlling the strength of image and text guidance) are preserved in this process, avoiding loss of control over editing strength that is seen in other adversarial distillation methods.
