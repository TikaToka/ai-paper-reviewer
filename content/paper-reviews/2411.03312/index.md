### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Vision Language Models (VLMs) are powerful but computationally expensive due to processing many visual tokens from images.  Current research mostly focuses on modestly reducing token numbers, while the trade-off with model size is unclear. This impacts deployment in real-world applications. 

This paper investigates the optimal trade-off between model size and the number of visual tokens.  It establishes scaling laws showing that for visual reasoning tasks, surprisingly, using the largest model with a minimal number of visual tokens (often one) leads to the best performance for a given computational budget.  The authors introduce a new query-based token compression algorithm designed for this extreme compression regime. The results demonstrate the need to reconsider token compression strategies and suggest focusing on more significant compression.

### In-depth insights


#### Optimal VLM Inference
Optimal VLM inference focuses on minimizing the computational cost of VLMs without sacrificing performance.  The core idea revolves around finding the best balance between the size of the Language Model (LLM) and the number of visual tokens processed.  **Contrary to existing methods that modestly reduce the visual token count, the research reveals that compute-optimal inference often involves using the largest possible LLM with a drastically reduced number of visual tokens, often just one.** This counterintuitive finding suggests that investing computational resources in a larger LLM yields greater accuracy improvements than attempting more sophisticated visual token compression. However, this optimal behavior is context-dependent; it holds true particularly for visual reasoning tasks with cached text queries.  When the text input is variable, a small increase in visual tokens may become necessary to balance costs.  Furthermore, this optimal balance shifts with the nature of the task; for OCR tasks, for instance, the optimum shifts towards utilizing more visual tokens and potentially smaller LLMs, highlighting the task-specific nature of optimal VLM inference. **Therefore, future research should focus on achieving high token compression to optimize VLM inference for various tasks.**

#### Scaling Laws for VLMs
The concept of "Scaling Laws for VLMs" investigates how the performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) changes in relation to key architectural parameters, particularly **model size (number of parameters)** and the **number of visual tokens** processed.  The research likely explores empirical relationships, establishing mathematical formulas or curves that predict performance based on these parameters. This would involve training VLMs with varying parameter counts and visual token resolutions, then measuring their performance on benchmark tasks.  **A key insight** might be whether increasing model size is more beneficial than reducing the number of visual tokens (perhaps via compression techniques) for a fixed compute budget.  The study might reveal optimal scaling strategies, indicating the best balance between model size and visual token count for maximum efficiency. This could potentially lead to **design guidelines** for creating more cost-effective VLMs, especially for resource-constrained applications.  Furthermore, understanding these scaling laws might highlight the **trade-offs** between computational cost and performance, informing researchers in the development of novel architectures and training methodologies. The findings may reveal surprising trends, like a point of diminishing returns in increasing the number of visual tokens, thus advocating for more focused compression techniques.

#### Token Compression
The concept of token compression in the context of Vision Language Models (VLMs) is crucial for optimizing inference speed and efficiency.  **The core idea is to reduce the number of visual tokens representing images before feeding them into the language model**, thereby decreasing computational cost and latency.  Many existing methods achieve modest compression, typically reducing the token count by a factor of 5-10x. However, the research highlights that **this approach may not be optimal**. The paper argues that for visual reasoning tasks, **the best performance is achieved by using the largest possible language model and minimizing the visual token count, often to just one**. This finding suggests that the field should shift towards developing techniques for significantly higher compression ratios, rather than focusing on moderately preserving the performance of the base model. The paper's proposed query-based approach, which leverages the user's query to compress image information, represents a crucial step in this direction. This method specifically prioritizes keeping the tokens relevant to the query, ensuring minimal performance loss despite the high compression.  This work underscores the need for future research in developing effective algorithms tailored for high-compression scenarios, achieving significantly improved efficiency in VLMs without sacrificing accuracy.

#### Query-Based Approach
A query-based approach to visual token compression for Vision Language Models (VLMs) offers a compelling solution to the computational cost of processing numerous visual tokens.  **By incorporating the user's textual query into the compression process**, the algorithm intelligently selects and prioritizes the most relevant visual information, thereby achieving significant compression ratios while minimizing performance degradation.  This approach moves beyond the limitations of generic compression methods that treat all visual tokens equally, acknowledging that not all visual information is equally important for a given query.  The core innovation lies in the **integration of textual context** to guide the token selection.  This contextual awareness allows the system to focus on the aspects of the image that are most relevant to the user's request, leading to higher compression rates and better overall efficiency.  However, **successful implementation requires careful consideration of the interaction between query representation, visual feature extraction, and the compression algorithm itself**. The effectiveness of the method hinges on accurately capturing the essence of the query and its relevance to the visual data. This implies a need for sophisticated query embedding techniques and robust cross-modal alignment strategies.  Future work might explore improvements in query embedding to better represent complex or nuanced requests, as well as enhanced cross-modal interaction mechanisms to improve the fidelity of the compressed visual representation.  **A key advantage is that this approach can adapt to varying query types and complexities,** making it suitable for a broader range of real-world VLM applications.

#### Future Directions
Future research should prioritize extending the scaling laws to encompass a wider array of visual tasks and modalities, moving beyond the visual reasoning benchmarks used in this study.  **Investigating how optimal token counts and LLM sizes shift with diverse visual data types (e.g., medical imaging, satellite imagery) is crucial.**  Furthermore, exploring the interaction between different token compression techniques and LLM architectures is needed to identify synergistic combinations that maximize performance while minimizing compute.  **Developing more sophisticated query-based compression methods** that dynamically adapt to the complexity of the input query and the relevance of visual information could significantly improve efficiency.  Finally, **research should focus on developing novel evaluation metrics that better capture the nuances of visual-language understanding** at high compression ratios. The current metrics may not fully reflect the capabilities of VLMs in these extreme regimes, hindering the assessment of true performance gains.  This integrated approach will ultimately pave the way for more robust, efficient, and widely applicable VLMs.

> üîº This figure demonstrates how the optimal balance between the number of visual tokens and LLM size for VLMs varies depending on the length of the input text query (Q).  As Q increases, the cost of processing text tokens in the VLM increases. Therefore, the impact of adding more visual tokens becomes less significant relative to the impact of increasing LLM size. Initially, with short queries, using a larger LLM with fewer visual tokens is better. But with longer queries, using a smaller LLM with more visual tokens can become more optimal, as the added cost from extra visual tokens is outweighed by the benefits of a larger LLM. This demonstrates the importance of considering the interaction between text and visual tokens when optimizing VLM performance.

The left panel (a) shows that for visual reasoning tasks, increasing the number of text tokens makes the effect of adding more visual tokens less significant, because the text token processing dominates the computational cost. Conversely, for OCR and text understanding tasks (right panel, b), the performance is more strongly affected by the number of visual tokens than the LLM size, reversing the trend observed for visual reasoning.

Intuitively, at enough text tokens, initial increases in visual tokens are only a minor fraction of the overall compute (¬ß¬†3.3.2).

> üîº Figure 4 presents a bar chart comparing the performance of different Vision Language Models (VLMs) across various visual reasoning and text recognition tasks.  The models vary in their size (LLM parameter count) and the number of visual tokens processed.  Importantly, all models are evaluated at approximately the same inference compute cost. The chart shows that for visual reasoning tasks, increasing model size while simultaneously decreasing the number of visual tokens leads to better performance. This supports the finding that for these types of tasks, larger models can leverage smaller sets of well-chosen visual information more effectively. In contrast, for text recognition tasks, reducing the number of visual tokens negatively impacts the model's performance, regardless of model size. This indicates that text recognition relies more heavily on the detail contained within a large number of visual tokens.

The process begins with user input text tokens, processed by the LLM backbone to produce text embeddings. These embeddings are combined with the original visual tokens.  The core of QueCC then downsamples these query-embedded visual tokens using a convolutional layer, followed by applying local cross-attention between the downsampled tokens and their corresponding visual token regions.
