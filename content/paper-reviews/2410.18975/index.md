### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

This research introduces UNBOUNDED, a groundbreaking video game that uses AI to create a truly infinite and dynamic gameplay experience. Unlike traditional video games with pre-defined rules and endings, UNBOUNDED leverages cutting-edge generative AI models to produce an ever-evolving virtual world and character interactions.  Players interact with the game's AI-controlled character using natural language, shaping the story's progression and influencing the character's actions and experiences. The game's AI dynamically generates game mechanics, narratives, and visuals, constantly adapting to player input and creating unpredictable, emergent scenarios. To build UNBOUNDED, the researchers introduced two key innovations: a specialized, distilled large language model (LLM) that generates in real-time,  and a dynamic regional image prompt adapter (IP-Adapter) for vision models that ensures consistent, yet flexible visual generation.  Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, the researchers demonstrated that UNBOUNDED significantly improves character life simulation, user instruction following, narrative coherence, and visual consistency compared to traditional approaches. This work is important because it demonstrates the potential for AI to revolutionize game design, opening up possibilities for creating more immersive, personalized, and engaging gaming experiences.

The user can interact with the generative game using natural language, and Archibus' hunger, energy and fun meters update accordingly. A spontaneous and unconstrained story unfolds while the user playing, and the character can explore new environments with a myriad of possible actions and unexpected interactions. The game runs in interactive speeds, refreshing every second.")
