<table id='0' style='font-size:14px'><tr><td>Inputs</td><td>Labels</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: I've been dating this guy for 2 years, and when things are good, they're great. We have deep conversations about various topics, share laughs, and seem to have a strong connection. However, every few months, he suddenly becomes distant. The usual daily communication slows down, his tone becomes cold, and there's a noticeable disconnect. After giving it some space and bringing it up gently, he admits to withdrawing and usually provides a reason for his behavior, such as feeling disrespected or abandoned. We address the issues, talk about feelings and needs, and find better ways to communicate. He has a therapist, and I encourage him to work on these issues, but the cycle repeats. Thoughts: I am not enough for him. Why do I always get hurt like this. I always get stuck in these endless cycles, and I am unlovable.</td><td>helpless; unlovable</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: I would move out, but I don't have the money for that nor do I have the job. Whenever I get I job, I take too many sick days out because of the bruises and scarring on my face are hard to hide. Thoughts: I can 't move out until I have a better financial situation. I must remain in this situation until I have more money. The only way out is to be more financially secure. I cannot let other people know or help me. I have to sick days to hide the bruising on my face. Other people can't find out what's happening. I must solve this all on my own.</td><td>helpless; unlovable</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: Ever since, I have known in the back of my mind that he still does this, helpless; unlovable; worthless and have gotten up in the middle of the night a few times to find him masturbating and video chatting publicly or with females who are at least scantily clad, if not nude and masturbating themselves. When I confront him about it, he says he has a public sex fetish and needs to fulfill it, believing that it helps keep him ,,faithful%o to me since I am no longer interested. Thoughts: He calls that faithful? It doesn't feel faithful. But I don't know ifI even have the right to feel the way I do about it - after all, that's pretty much how our relationship started. Am I even allowed to be upset? I'm the one that changed, so it feels like it's my fault. I shouldn't be blaming him. He tried to get me involved, but when I said I wasn 't into it, he didn't push, he just continued on doing what made him happy. Plus, he's not doing this to hurt me, so I shouldn't feel hurt by it. I should be happy for him that he is feeling fulfilled. But I feel sad, like he doesn't want me anymore.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Situation: Do Ihave schizophrenia or something Thoughts: I am scared and don't helpless know what is happening. I fear this could be something very serious. There is something wrong with me. I don't know what to do.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Situation: I was born with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, O.C.D. and helpless; unlovable; worthless I am also transgendered. As a result, I was a very difficult child to raise. There was constant fighting between myself and my parents. At the age of ten, I was sent away to an institution for two years. While there, I was physically, emotionally, and sexually abused. I couldn't talk to anyone because I had no trust in adults. Thoughts: I was born defective and wrong, so that's why my parents had such a hard time raising me. I was hard to love because I was so different. It was my fault that they had to send me away; I needed to be fixed. Then, I was abused while I was away but I couldn't talk to anyone about it because I was scared that ifI said anything, I'd be sent even further away.</td><td></td></tr></table>
