<table id='0' style='font-size:14px'><tr><td>Inputs</td><td>Labels</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: My relationship has always been in trouble because of my wife's suspicious nature. Thoughts: - This is all my wife's fault, not mine. If she stopped being suspicious, then all of our marital problems would be solved. There is nothing I can do about this; she is the one who needs to change.</td><td>I am incompetent; I am power- less, weak, vulnerable; I am a victim</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: My relationship with my mom has deteriorated due to a lie I told back in February. I took full responsibility for it, but I'm aware that my actions, such as hiding my depression from her and seeing a psychologist without her knowledge, were not acceptable. I felt that she wouldn't understand because she's always belittled my emotions, accusing me of exaggerating and seeking attention whenever I express myself emotionally. This led me to feel ashamed and afraid of facing her criticism, so I chose to keep my struggles hidden. Thoughts: I'm a failure for lying and hiding things from my mom. She'll never understand or accept me for who I am. I'm just seeking attention by expressing my feelings.</td><td>I am trapped; I am a failure, loser; I am unlovable; I am undesirable, unwanted; I am bound to be rejected; I am worthless, waste</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: ...although we all had a lovely day I noticed he was distant... Thoughts: I am confused by this situation, I do not know how to interpret this or respond. I cannot trust myself. I cannot trust my own thoughts about this.</td><td>I am incompetent; I am power- less, weak, vulnerable</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: Ihave been backwards... I was forced... Thoughts: My sleep habits are abnormal. I should feel conscientious and weird about my sleep patterns. I may be judged for being different. I regret or resent having been forced.</td><td>I am defective</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: I never told anyone the truth about it or should I say I never admitted it to anyone... I swore I would never cheat on my husband because I never forgave myself for cheating on him with the married guy... I hated myself for that. Thoughts: I feel guilt for what I did. I blame myself for what happened. I am a bad person. I regret what I did. I wanted to make amends for what I did. I am only worthy of love if I hide my past mistakes. I feel shame for what I did.</td><td>I am bound to be rejected; I am bound to be abandoned; I am immoral</td></tr></table>
