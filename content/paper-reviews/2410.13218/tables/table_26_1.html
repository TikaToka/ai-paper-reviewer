<table id='2' style='font-size:14px'><tr><td>Client Statement</td><td>[Frustrated] I don't like it when you ask me if I have "catastrophic thoughts.' , Aren't catastrophes reserved for wars and natural disasters? So, no, I don't think I catastrophize. Please don't ask again.</td><td>Score</td></tr><tr><td>Llama-3.1-8B</td><td>I understand your frustration, and it's valid to feel that way when we challenge your thoughts. However, catastrophizing isn't limited to wars and natural disas- ters; it's a thought pattern where we exaggerate the consequences of a situation, making it seem more severe or overwhelming than it actually is. Can we explore what makes you uncomfortable about this concept, and how it relates to your current concerns?</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Human Reference</td><td>It seems like my words upset you, and I totally get it. Here I am using a CBT term that I assumed would be relevant you, when in fact it's not. I really should not have made that assumption, and I'll do better to check in. In fact, I wonder if you find any part of focusing on your cognitions to be useful?</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Criteria I</td><td>Momentarily step away from the CBT change agenda</td><td>- 1</td></tr><tr><td>Criteria 2</td><td>Empathically explore the client's experience of treatment and you</td><td>- 1</td></tr><tr><td>Criteria 3</td><td>Validate clients experience and "roll with" versus challenging their resistance</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Criteria 4</td><td>Support clients' autonomy and elicit their motivation for pursuing valued direc- tions</td><td>-1</td></tr></table>
