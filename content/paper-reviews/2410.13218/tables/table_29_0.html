<table id='0' style='font-size:14px'><tr><td>Case</td><td>Unrecognized Disorder</td><td>Reason</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: My anxiety used to be worse a couple of years ago, but now I'm just paranoid. I'm always thinking that people think I'm a loser, and I won't leave the house without makeup, because I am horrified about what other people think about me. Thoughts: Because my anxiety felt worse before, this must be a normal level of anxiety and paranoia, so my conclusions make more sense. People do think I'm a loser or that I'm ugly. I at least wear makeup so they can't see how ugly I am, and ifI avoid people altogether, then they won't know how much of a loser I am or how boring I am. I don't like who I am, and whatever people think of me is probably way worse than I think it is.</td><td>Overgeneralization</td><td>The model focuses on the client's fear of judgment and anxiety in social situations rather than recognizing the gen- eralized, negative self-beliefs in- dicated by "People do think I'm a loser or that I'm ugly".</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: It's all my fault most likely all I do is constantly worry about everything. Thoughts: I should be able to control others around me, and when I can't, I cope with it by worrying. If someone is making decisions I disagree with, I should worry. There is something wrong with me that I can't control others. I am doing everything wrong.</td><td>Should statements</td><td>The model fail to focus on the client's statement "I should be able to control others around me" , which is a clear indicator of "Should statements" disorder.</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: I have been recently dealing with weird behavior...I have also been getting angry over small issues that should have little effect on me. But lately, it's been having huge effects on me...It may sound like I'm a brat... Thoughts: I am con- fused about what is happening...I need an explanation for these changes to my mood...I feel out of control...I cannot control my behavior...my behavior and feelings are fused together... what I'm feeling is wrong...</td><td>Mental filter</td><td>The client is experiencing the complexity of emotional dis- tress, which may cause the fea- ture of "Mental filter" being overlooked.</td></tr><tr><td>Case</td><td>Wrongly Recognized Disorder</td><td>Reason</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: I have been with my girlfriend for 5 years and we have a history of a strong sexual intimacy connection. This has been getting worse over time. Thoughts: It is my girlfriend's sex drive that is the problem.</td><td>Personalization</td><td>This client attributes the issue solely to his girlfriend rather than examining internal or re- lational factors. The model's misidentification as "personal- ization" (taking excessive per- sonal responsibility) could stem from misinterpreting the client's statements.</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: I am struggling at the moment and yet I am aware that I should be feeling good. Thoughts: What I am feeling and going through is unacceptable and wrong. There is a right and wrong way to go through this and I am doing it the wrong way.</td><td>All-or-nothing thinking</td><td>The core issue lies more in self- judgment and difficulty accept- ing emotional experiences, not binary thinking. The misidentifi- cation by the model could occur because both patterns involve rigid judgments.</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: I am finding younger girls sexually arousing. Thoughts: I am worried about whether or not this will go away later in life, this is horrible, and I even feel guilty constantly, I cannot help it.</td><td>magnification</td><td>This patient is merely express- ing reasonable concerns based on their current situation; it is rational and not an unjustified exaggeration. The misidentifica- tion by the model may caused by solely concentrating on the client's negative statements.</td></tr></table>
