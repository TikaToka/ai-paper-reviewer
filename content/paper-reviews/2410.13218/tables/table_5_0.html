We can revisit and possibly modify our plan for today. How about we first take a step back and explore your thinking about this? What thoughts are you noticing as we discuss the agenda?</td></tr><tr><td>Negotiating a session agenda</td><td>Intermediate</td><td>[Agitated] Wow. You won't believe what happened this week. It's a really long story Â· ..</td><td>It sounds like there 's a lot on your mind, and I'd like to hear about it. Would it be OK to take a second to discuss our agenda for the day first, including where discussing this past week might fit in, as well as anything else you want to take up here today? I want to make sure that we budget our time accordingly. Shall we start with a homework check-in and then tackle the story?</td></tr><tr><td>Responding to therapeutic alliance ruptures</td><td>Advanced</td><td>[Anxious] I did the measure you asked me to fill out. Honestly, I think I might have rated you lower than usual, but I'm not sure I want to talk about it.</td><td>I was just noticing that your trust in me has gone down some. I wonder if you could help me appreciate what that's like for you? I'd far prefer persisting with our agenda when you may have diminishing that to just faith in it or me.</td></tr></table>
