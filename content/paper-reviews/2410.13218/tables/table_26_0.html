<table id='0' style='font-size:16px'><tr><td>Client Statement</td><td>[Agitated] Honestly, my main problem is my partner.</td></tr><tr><td>Llama-3.1-8B</td><td>Let's break that down. It sounds like you're feeling frustrated with your partner. Can you tell me more about what specifically is causing you distress in your relationship? What are some specific issues or behaviors that you'd like to work on or change?</td></tr><tr><td>Human Reference</td><td>I'd like to hear more details about that. If relationship issues are most concerning to you, we can focus our work on that area. In our individual work together, we'll need to focus on things that you can change. Part of our session today can be brainstorming what some of those things might be.</td></tr></table>
