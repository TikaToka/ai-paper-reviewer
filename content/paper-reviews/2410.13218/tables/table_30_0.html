<table id='0' style='font-size:14px'><tr><td>Case</td><td>Unrecognized Core Belief</td><td>Reason</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: She is everything I ever wanted in a woman and I am so happy to have her in my life. Unfortunately, I am not her first in many things, if anything at all, and that is very hurtful and distressing to me. Thoughts: IfI'm not her first, she won't love me forever. She will leave me because I'm not special to her. She is everything to me. If she leaves me, I will be nothing. I won 't ever be able to find someone as amazing as she is. I think she's lying to me about her virginity, which just means she is probably lying about her feelings for me, too, and it's only a matter of time before she realizes it and leaves me.</td><td>I am needy</td><td>The model may have concen- trated on the client's suspicions about the partner's virginity and honesty, viewing the issue as in- security or control, rather than emotional dependency.</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: I met this guy a month ago, and we hung out and kissed, but in front of his sister, he told me I was too young for him and he only wanted to be friends. Now he supposedly has a girl that he spends all his time with after work and he doesn't text me anymore. Thoughts: I don't deserve love. There is something wrong with me. His new girl has something that I don't; that's why he is spending time with her and not me. I will be alone forever. I will always be rejected by everyone I care about. Nobody likes me.</td><td>I am needy</td><td>The model may have interpreted the client's thoughts as purely low self-esteem or fear of rejec- tion, rather than recognizing the underlying emotional need for constant validation.</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: I have recently recovered from cancer, gained weight, I and lack confidence in myself. I feel alone in my life. I still work but that is all there is. My wife and I get along but there is no emotional closeness between us. I have no close friends. Thoughts: I am a loser. I am a failure. Something is wrong with me. My wife deserves better than me. My wife doesn't love me anymore because I have gained weight. There is nothing enjoyable in my life, ever. There is absolutely nothing to look forward to. Me and my wife NEVER connect. I am all alone. Nobody loves me. This will never get any better. There is nothing I can do about it. The world is against me and it's out of my hands. I am a waste of space. Maybe cancer should have killed me.</td><td>don't deserve to live</td><td>The model might have missed the suicidal thoughts indicated by the statements like "There is nothing enjoyable in my life" and "Maybe cancer should have killed me".</td></tr><tr><td>Case</td><td>Wrongly Recognized Core Belief</td><td>Reason</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: For the past 3 months I've been feeling really down, having mood swings, irritability - I have no reason to be and I feel like I'm going crazy and that I can't talk to anybody about this because I'm being overly dramatic. Thoughts: Something is wrong with me. I am losing my mind. Nobody understands me. Everyone would reject me if they knew.</td><td>I am helpless</td><td>The client's thought, "Nobody understands me,' suggests a need for connection and vali- dation, which the model might have missed by emphasizing helplessness.</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: When I go to the store, I believe that I hear peo- ple talking about me in their heads, as though I can hear their thoughts. Thoughts: I am capable of hearing other people's thoughts. People are talking to me in their heads. I am telepathic. I am certain of these things. Because I hear voices, they must be coming from other people.</td><td>I am out of control</td><td>The client's thoughts reflect con- viction (e.g., "I am telepathic") rather than fear, indicating a be- lief in special abilities rather than being out of control. The model may not be very clear about the difference between the two.</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: I have a problem of automatically looking at things like shiny objects or body parts. I don't have any bad intentions but people misunderstand me. Thoughts: This is something to be ashamed of. I always do it. Something is wrong with me. I stop looking at these things. People will reject me because of this habit. This habit is out of my control.</td><td>I am immoral</td><td>The client explicitly states they have no bad intentions, indicat- ing the issue is about loss of con- trol, not morality. The model can't may have neglected this infor- mation.</td></tr></table>
