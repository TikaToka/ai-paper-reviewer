<table id='0' style='font-size:14px'><tr><td>Datasets</td><td>Inputs</td><td>Labels</td></tr><tr><td>CBT-CD</td><td>Situation: Our wedding was put off because his parents asked him to build a house for them 2 months before our wedding! They had a perfectly good house at the time they just wanted their dream house. Thoughts: I am a victim with no power in this situation. I must accept this behavior. I am too scared to leave this situation. I am not worthy of better. His parents hate me. His parents do not want us to get married. He may not want to marry me either. He loves his parents more than me. I will always be second in his life. His parents had no need for a house, and I know this for sure. I am aware of every aspect of this situation.</td><td>all-or-nothing thinking; person- alization; mind reading</td></tr><tr><td>CBT-PC</td><td>Situation: I had an amazing childhood. When I was twelve in 2004, my father had to go to Iraq. My mother thought it would be best if she moved my brother and I back to the U.S., where we would have family support. I was very depressed because my dad was my hero and I blamed my mom for everything that went wrong. I felt like no one understood me... When my dad came back, he wanted a divorce from my mother. Thoughts: Everything was great until my mom messed everything up. Because of her, my brother and I had to leave our dad. We ended up living somewhere where no one liked me. It's her fault that I never felt like I fit in. Even when my dad came back, he didn't want us either - he wanted a divorce. I guess no one will ever want me in their life. I'll probably be alone forever.</td><td>helpless; unlovable</td></tr><tr><td>CBT-FC</td><td>Situation: My daughter was recently diagnosed as bipolar. If I say anything about seeking treatment, my daughter accuses me of not understanding her and what is happening to her. She is very paranoid and worries about her safety all the time. I need to know how to talk to her and what to do to get her into treatment. Thoughts: I am a bad mother. This is my fault. It is so shameful that my daughter has bipolar. If my daughter gets worse, then it will be my fault for not getting her into treatment. I need to do something. This is my responsibility.</td><td>I am incompetent; I am help- less; I am powerless, weak, vul- nerable; I am bad - dangerous, toxic, evil</td></tr></table>
