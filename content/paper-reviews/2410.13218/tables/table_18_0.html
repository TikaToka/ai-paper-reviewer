This has been getting worse over time. Thoughts: It is my girlfriend's sex drive that is the problem.</td><td>overgeneralization; labeling</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: I am struggling at the moment and yet I am aware that I should be feeling good. Thoughts: What I am feeling and going through are unacceptable and wrong. There is a right and wrong way to go through this and I am doing it the wrong way.</td><td>should statements; emotional reasoning</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: The individual has recently discovered that their mom has cheated on their dad four times in the past. Each time, the parents attended counseling, where the mom initially denied her infidelity but eventually admitted to it, blaming their dad for not meeting her needs. Thoughts: I cannot trust anyone, why is everyone a liar. My mom has betrayed me. Of course something like this is happening to me, it only happens to me.</td><td>all-or-nothing thinking; overgeneraliza- tion; emotional reasoning</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: I experienced a recent setback with my OCD symptoms that had been in remission Thoughts: I have no longer won the battle against my OCD</td><td>all-or-nothing thinking; magnification</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: My anxiety used to be worse a couple of years ago, but now im just paranoid. Im always thinking that people think im a loser, and I wont leave the house without makeup, because i am horrified about what other people think about me. Thoughts: Because my anxiety felt worse before, this must be a normal level of anxiety and paranoia, so my conclusions make more sense. People do think I'm a loser or that I'm ugly. I at least wear makeup so they can't see how ugly I am, and ifI avoid people altogether, then they won't know how much of a loser I am or how boring I am. I don't like who I am, and whatever people think of me is probably way worse than I think it is.</td><td>overgeneralization; emotional reasoning; mind reading</td></tr></table>
