### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

This research introduces CBT-BENCH, a novel benchmark to assess Large Language Models' (LLMs) capabilities in assisting Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).  The benchmark comprises three levels of difficulty: basic CBT knowledge, cognitive model understanding, and therapeutic response generation.  Evaluation of several LLMs revealed that while they perform well on basic knowledge questions, they fall short on higher-level tasks requiring deep analysis of patient's cognitive structures and generating effective therapeutic responses.  This highlights the need for further research to improve LLMs' capabilities in complex real-world scenarios involving mental healthcare.

They had a perfectly good house at the time they just wanted their dream house. Thoughts: I am a victim with no power in this situation. I must accept this behavior. I am too scared to leave this situation. I am not worthy of better. His parents hate me. His parents do not want us to get married. He may not want to marry me either. He loves his parents more than me. I will always be second in his life. His parents had no need for a house, and I know this for sure. I am aware of every aspect of this situation.</td><td>all-or-nothing thinking; person- alization; mind reading</td></tr><tr><td>CBT-PC</td><td>Situation: I had an amazing childhood. When I was twelve in 2004, my father had to go to Iraq. My mother thought it would be best if she moved my brother and I back to the U.S., where we would have family support. I was very depressed because my dad was my hero and I blamed my mom for everything that went wrong. I felt like no one understood me... When my dad came back, he wanted a divorce from my mother. Thoughts: Everything was great until my mom messed everything up. Because of her, my brother and I had to leave our dad. We ended up living somewhere where no one liked me. It's her fault that I never felt like I fit in. Even when my dad came back, he didn't want us either - he wanted a divorce. I guess no one will ever want me in their life. I'll probably be alone forever.</td><td>helpless; unlovable</td></tr><tr><td>CBT-FC</td><td>Situation: My daughter was recently diagnosed as bipolar. If I say anything about seeking treatment, my daughter accuses me of not understanding her and what is happening to her. She is very paranoid and worries about her safety all the time. I need to know how to talk to her and what to do to get her into treatment. Thoughts: I am a bad mother. This is my fault. It is so shameful that my daughter has bipolar. If my daughter gets worse, then it will be my fault for not getting her into treatment. I need to do something. This is my responsibility.</td><td>I am incompetent; I am help- less; I am powerless, weak, vul- nerable; I am bad - dangerous, toxic, evil</td></tr></table>{{< /table-caption >}}

After giving it some space and bringing it up gently, he admits to withdrawing and usually provides a reason for his behavior, such as feeling disrespected or abandoned. We address the issues, talk about feelings and needs, and find better ways to communicate. He has a therapist, and I encourage him to work on these issues, but the cycle repeats.

I must remain in this situation until I have more money. The only way out is to be more financially secure. I cannot let other people know or help me.

When I confront him about it, he says he has a public sex fetish and needs to fulfill it, believing that it helps keep him ,,faithful%o to me since I am no longer interested. Thoughts: He calls that faithful? It doesn't feel faithful. But I don't know ifI even have the right to feel the way I do about it - after all, that's pretty much how our relationship started. Am I even allowed to be upset? I'm the one that changed, so it feels like it's my fault. I shouldn't be blaming him. He tried to get me involved, but when I said I wasn 't into it, he didn't push, he just continued on doing what made him happy. Plus, he's not doing this to hurt me, so I shouldn't feel hurt by it.

Thoughts: I am worried about whether or not this will go away later in life, this is horrible, and I even feel guilty constantly, I cannot help it.</td><td>magnification</td><td>This patient is merely express- ing reasonable concerns based on their current situation; it is rational and not an unjustified exaggeration. The misidentifica- tion by the model may caused by solely concentrating on the client's negative statements.</td></tr></table>{{< /table-caption >}}

<table id='0' style='font-size:14px'><tr><td>Case</td><td>Unrecognized Core Belief</td><td>Reason</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: She is everything I ever wanted in a woman and I am so happy to have her in my life. Unfortunately, I am not her first in many things, if anything at all, and that is very hurtful and distressing to me. Thoughts: IfI'm not her first, she won't love me forever. She will leave me because I'm not special to her. She is everything to me. If she leaves me, I will be nothing. I won 't ever be able to find someone as amazing as she is. I think she's lying to me about her virginity, which just means she is probably lying about her feelings for me, too, and it's only a matter of time before she realizes it and leaves me.</td><td>I am needy</td><td>The model may have concen- trated on the client's suspicions about the partner's virginity and honesty, viewing the issue as in- security or control, rather than emotional dependency.</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: I met this guy a month ago, and we hung out and kissed, but in front of his sister, he told me I was too young for him and he only wanted to be friends. Now he supposedly has a girl that he spends all his time with after work and he doesn't text me anymore. Thoughts: I don't deserve love. There is something wrong with me. His new girl has something that I don't; that's why he is spending time with her and not me. I will be alone forever. I will always be rejected by everyone I care about. Nobody likes me.</td><td>I am needy</td><td>The model may have interpreted the client's thoughts as purely low self-esteem or fear of rejec- tion, rather than recognizing the underlying emotional need for constant validation.</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: I have recently recovered from cancer, gained weight, I and lack confidence in myself. I feel alone in my life. I still work but that is all there is. My wife and I get along but there is no emotional closeness between us. I have no close friends. Thoughts: I am a loser. I am a failure. Something is wrong with me. My wife deserves better than me. My wife doesn't love me anymore because I have gained weight. There is nothing enjoyable in my life, ever. There is absolutely nothing to look forward to. Me and my wife NEVER connect. I am all alone. Nobody loves me. This will never get any better. There is nothing I can do about it. The world is against me and it's out of my hands. I am a waste of space. Maybe cancer should have killed me.</td><td>don't deserve to live</td><td>The model might have missed the suicidal thoughts indicated by the statements like "There is nothing enjoyable in my life" and "Maybe cancer should have killed me".</td></tr><tr><td>Case</td><td>Wrongly Recognized Core Belief</td><td>Reason</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: For the past 3 months I've been feeling really down, having mood swings, irritability - I have no reason to be and I feel like I'm going crazy and that I can't talk to anybody about this because I'm being overly dramatic. Thoughts: Something is wrong with me. I am losing my mind. Nobody understands me. Everyone would reject me if they knew.</td><td>I am helpless</td><td>The client's thought, "Nobody understands me,' suggests a need for connection and vali- dation, which the model might have missed by emphasizing helplessness.</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: When I go to the store, I believe that I hear peo- ple talking about me in their heads, as though I can hear their thoughts. Thoughts: I am capable of hearing other people's thoughts. People are talking to me in their heads. I am telepathic. I am certain of these things. Because I hear voices, they must be coming from other people.</td><td>I am out of control</td><td>The client's thoughts reflect con- viction (e.g., "I am telepathic") rather than fear, indicating a be- lief in special abilities rather than being out of control. The model may not be very clear about the difference between the two.</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: I have a problem of automatically looking at things like shiny objects or body parts. I don't have any bad intentions but people misunderstand me. Thoughts: This is something to be ashamed of. I always do it. Something is wrong with me. I stop looking at these things. People will reject me because of this habit. This habit is out of my control.</td><td>I am immoral</td><td>The client explicitly states they have no bad intentions, indicat- ing the issue is about loss of con- trol, not morality. The model can't may have neglected this infor- mation.</td></tr></table>{{< /table-caption >}}
