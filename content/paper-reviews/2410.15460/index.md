### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) sometimes produce inaccurate or irrelevant outputs, known as hallucinations. This paper investigates the relationship between the training process and hallucinations.  The researchers found that hallucination rates oscillate throughout training, and this variability isn't easily fixed by just reducing general training loss.  They propose a new training method called Sensitive Neuron Dropout (SeND) that addresses this issue by identifying and selectively removing neurons that exhibit significant variability during training.  This method is shown to significantly reduce hallucinations across different LLM sizes, and it is made more efficient through the use of a new metric called Efficient EigenScore (EES).  The empirical results demonstrate that SeND can improve LLM reliability by up to 40% while also being computationally efficient.  The research highlights the importance of considering the training process itself when trying to improve the reliability of LLMs.

![](charts/charts_4_0.png "üîº Figure 1: Visualization of Oscillatory Behavior Across Varying LLM Sizes. Hallucination metrics are evaluated at equidistant checkpoints of the Pythia models, with sizes 70M, 160M, 410M, 1B, 1.4B, 2.8B, 6.9B, 12B. Part (a) presents the performance of the Pythia models under the SelfCheckGPT metric. Average performance is indicated by solid lines, while the shaded regions represent the standard deviation. Higher SelfCheckGPT score indicates a higher probability of self-contradiction and higher probability of confabulation. Part (b) depicts the same experimental setup, but hallucination measured on the XSum v2 dataset, where Rouge1 is used as the performance metric. A higher Rouge1 score suggests a better alignment of the generated text to that of the reference summary. For all model sizes, we observe a pronounced trend of high variance and oscillatory behavior in hallucination rates. This fluctuation highlights the models' uncertainty at specific time stamps and emphasizes the need for a robust mitigation strategy to stabilize performance during training.")
