<br><table id='6' style='font-size:14px'><tr><td>Task</td><td>Prompt</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>Plan Generation</td><td>Generate an explanation and analy- sis, and plan to generate a prompt for writing a swi-prolog code for the last task. The 3 sections should be exactly outlined. Your plan should show enough intermediate reasoning steps towards the answer. Construct the plan as much as you can and describe the logic specifi- cally. When constructing the plan for the code prompt, actively use swi prolog search capabilities.</td><td>Detailed instructions for generating an outline and plan, with an em- phasis on reasoning steps and using Prolog's search capabilities.</td></tr><tr><td>Code Generation</td><td>Write a Prolog code to solve us- ing the plan. If there are un- known or stochastic atoms or pred- icates, fill in the values for them as a logical assumption and add a comment in the same line As- sumed atom/predicate". Do not use write and read commands within the code. The code should be very detailed and utilize swi prolog ca- pabilities to the fullest. To run the program, at the end create a pred- icate named "query" that returns the correct numerical answer. The last line of the program should be the commented-out driver predicate , query". Write only the code.</td><td>Instructions for generating a Pro- log code based on the plan with as- sumptions for unknown atoms. Em- phasizes code details and a final "query" predicate.</td></tr><tr><td>Simulated Search</td><td>Ignoring the read commands, ex- plicitly write out the search paths that are explored by the code: #### Here are the paths [Starting Search Simulation]: #### [Path 1]:</td><td>A task to simulate and display the search paths that the Prolog code would follow during execution.</td></tr><tr><td>Final Answer</td><td>Given the plan, the code and the explored search paths answer the question above. Answer with the correct numerical answer. ##### Here is the answer:</td><td>Final prompt asking for the correct numerical answer based on the pre- vious steps.</td></tr></table>
