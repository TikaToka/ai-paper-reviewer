[{"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.16937/x1.png", "caption": "Figure 1: Comparison of standard KD and TAID. (Left) Standard KD methods typically employ direct optimization towards a fixed teacher distribution. (Right) TAID creates a dynamic bridge through adaptive, time-dependent intermediate teacher distributions (green dashed lines), enabling gradual optimization of the student. This approach facilitates a flexible transition from the student\u2019s initial distribution towards the teacher\u2019s distribution over time, effectively addressing the capacity gap and balancing knowledge transfer across varying model sizes.", "description": "\uadf8\ub9bc 1\uc740 \ud45c\uc900 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\ub958(KD)\uc640 TAID\uc758 \ube44\uad50\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc67c\ucabd\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud45c\uc900 KD \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uace0\uc815\ub41c teacher \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud5a5\ud574 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74 \uc624\ub978\ucabd \uadf8\ub9bc\uc740 TAID\uac00 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uac04 teacher \ubd84\ud3ec(\ub179\uc0c9 \uc810\uc120)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uacb0 \ub2e4\ub9ac\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5 \ucd08\uae30 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 student \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c teacher \ubd84\ud3ec\ub85c \uc774\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uc804\uc774\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4.
