Especially, the pronunciation of Chinese names may be recognized as similar-sounding English words, for exmaple, \"Si Li\" may be transcribed as \"Celine\" or \"silence\".\n| - When encountering words that seem out of place, it is likely due to errors in speech recognition. Examine the list of attendees to determine if the pronunciation of these words are similar to any English or Chinese names listed.\n| - You should consider the context of the meeting and the names of the attendees to determine if you or someone are cued.\n| <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">CONTINUE ON THE NEXT PAGE</span>", "caption": "Table 14: Prompt used for generating response in the Meeting Engagement module.", "description": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 \ud45c 14\ub294 \ud68c\uc758 \ucc38\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \uc774 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ud68c\uc758 \ub300\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ud68c\uc758\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc2dc\uc810\uc5d0 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ubc1c\uc5b8\uc744 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub294 \ucc38\uac00\uc790\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560, \ud68c\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c, \uad00\ub828 \ubc30\uacbd \uc9c0\uc2dd, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc9c4\ud589 \uc911\uc778 \ud68c\uc758 \ub0b4\uc6a9 \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, LLM\uc774  \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \ub610\ud55c,  \ubd80\uc801\uc808\ud55c \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ub300\ud654 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95 \ub4f1\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "section": "3 LLM-based Meeting Delegate System"}, {"content": "| The output of response <Response> | - The response should be a dictionary with the following format: \n\n```\n{\n    \"thoughts\": \"<thoughts>\",\n    \"speak\": \"<speak>\"\n}\n```\n- <thoughts>: The reasoning or considerations to judge whether you can speak and decide what to say.

Reference the transcript for context. |\n| **Evaluation Guidelines** | Compare main points in the standard and actual responses. Summarize the actual response's main points at the same granularity as the standard answer. Omit uninformative politeness or pleasantries (e.g., \"If you need more help, please let me know.\"). |\n| **Matching Main Points** |  Identify semantically similar main points between the actual and standard responses.  Create a list showing the index of each matching point in the actual response relative to the standard answer's main point order (e.g., if the first main point in the actual response matches the second in the standard answer, list the index '2'). If there is no match, use '-1'.|\n| **Metrics** | Count the number of main points in the actual response (ActualMainPointsCount) and the number of matching points (MatchingMainPointsCount). |\n| **Output Format** | JSON format, including explanation of steps, actual main points, counts, matching main points, matching indices, and the number of matching main points. If the actual response is empty, all counts should be 0.  Maintain the same length of MatchingIndex as the ActualMainPointsCount. |\n| **Example Matching Indices** | If ActualMainPointsCount is 5, the MatchingIndex might be [1, 2, -1, -1, 4], showing that the first, second, and fifth main points of the actual response match points 1, 2, and 4 in the standard answer respectively, while the third and fourth do not match any. |", "caption": "Table 17: Prompt used for evaluating the generated response against the ground-truth one.", "description": "\ud45c 17\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc751\ub2f5\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\ub2f5\uacfc \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \uc774 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc744 \uc694\uc57d\ud558\uace0, \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc548\ub0b4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \uc77c\uce58 \uc5ec\ubd80 \ud310\ub2e8 \uc2dc,  \uc758\ubbf8\uc0c1 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc744 \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \ud310\ub2e8\ud558\uace0, \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc778\uc0ac\ub9d0\uc774\ub098 \uc815\uc911\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc678\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \ucd9c\ub825 \ud615\uc2dd\uc740 JSON\uc73c\ub85c,  \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub0b4\uc6a9 \uac1c\uc218,  \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub0b4\uc6a9 \uac1c\uc218,  \uc7ac\ud604\uc728,  \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4 \ub4f1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "section": "4 Benchmark Dataset"}, {"content": "## Example 1\n\n| StandardAnswer | ActualResponse | Explanation | ActualMainPoints | ActualMainPointsCount | MatchingMainPoints | MatchingIndex | MatchingMainPointsCount |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---| \n| [\"Calculated word error rate on Czech transcripts\", \"Conducted testing sessions with PERSON11 and PERSON18\", \"Contributed to the PROJECT3 deliverable\", \"Waiting for new tasks\"] | \"Hi everyone.
