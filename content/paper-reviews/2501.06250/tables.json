It also highlights datasets not specifically created for cel-animation but highly relevant to adjacent tasks, including Anim-400K, V2C-Animation, iHarmony4, SSHarmonization, HVIDIT, Alchemist, MangaZero, and Ads-1k, which support applications like dubbing, harmonization, layout, and scene cutting. Key metrics, such as the number of clips and samples, are included to emphasize the scope, scale, and applicability of these resources in animation research and development.", "description": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 \ud45c\ub294 \uc140 \uc560\ub2c8\uba54\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \uad00\ub828 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc694\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc140 \uc560\ub2c8\uba54\uc774\uc158 \uc791\uc5c5(\uc608: Sakuga-42M, AniSora, AnimeRun, ATD-12K, Mixamo-Line240, AnT \ubc0f PaintBucket-Character)\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc790\uc138\ud788 \uc694\uc57d\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc560\ub2c8\uba54\uc774\uc158 \uc774\ud574, \uc0dd\uc131, \uc911\uac04 \ud504\ub808\uc784 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc0c9\uc0c1 \uc9c0\uc815\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub461\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc140 \uc560\ub2c8\uba54\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4\uc9c0\uc9c0\ub294 \uc54a\uc558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub354\ube59, \uc870\ud654, \ub808\uc774\uc544\uc6c3 \ubc0f \uc7a5\uba74 \uc790\ub974\uae30\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uad00\ub828 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b(Anim-400K, V2C-\uc560\ub2c8\uba54\uc774\uc158, iHarmony4, SSHarmonization, HVIDIT, Alchemist, MangaZero \ubc0f Ads-1k \ud3ec\ud568)\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud074\ub9bd \ubc0f \uc0d8\ud50c \uc218\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc9c0\ud45c\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc5b4 \uc560\ub2c8\uba54\uc774\uc158 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc0f \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4\uc758 \ubc94\uc704, \uaddc\ubaa8 \ubc0f \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "section": "III.
