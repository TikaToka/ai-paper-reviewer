### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current multi-hop question answering (MQA) datasets lack explicit reasoning structures, hindering analysis of Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capabilities.  This limits our understanding of how LLMs tackle different reasoning complexities, and makes it difficult to evaluate their performance beyond just the final answer.  This paper addresses these issues by introducing GRS-QA, a new dataset that includes reasoning graphs illustrating the logical steps for each question-answer pair.  

GRS-QA provides a fine-grained analysis of LLM performance across varying reasoning structures.  By explicitly capturing reasoning pathways, it facilitates the development of new evaluation metrics focusing on the reasoning process itself, not just the answer accuracy.  The findings reveal that LLMs struggle with questions involving complex reasoning structures, prompting a call for more advanced models capable of handling intricate reasoning tasks and opening new avenues for research in structural analysis of LLMs.

> üîº This figure shows how reasoning graphs are constructed for a question-answer pair from the HotpotQA dataset.  The left side displays the positive reasoning graph, a visual representation of the logical steps needed to answer the question, built using sentences from the original dataset's supporting paragraphs. The right side demonstrates two types of negative reasoning graphs. These are created by either modifying the connections (edges) between sentences in the original graph or by adding extra sentences (nodes) that are not relevant to answering the question.  This illustrates how the structure of the reasoning path impacts the LLM's ability to answer the question, and will be investigated in the paper.

### In-depth insights


#### LLM Reasoning Gaps
The research paper section "LLM Reasoning Gaps" highlights crucial limitations in current Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning capabilities.  It emphasizes that existing multi-hop question answering (M-QA) datasets lack **explicit reasoning structures**, hindering a fine-grained analysis of LLMs' reasoning processes.  The authors argue that the entanglement of diverse reasoning structures within these datasets obscures the impact of structural complexity on LLM performance.  **This lack of explicit structure prevents the isolation and evaluation of individual reasoning steps**, impeding a deeper understanding of where LLMs succeed or fail. The section sets the stage for the introduction of a new dataset, GRS-QA, designed to address these limitations by explicitly incorporating reasoning structures for improved LLM performance analysis and to facilitate the exploration of the interplay between textual structures and semantic understanding in complex reasoning tasks.

#### GRS-QA Dataset
The GRS-QA dataset is a novel resource for evaluating multi-hop question answering, **uniquely incorporating explicit reasoning graph structures** for each question-answer pair. Unlike existing datasets that entangle reasoning structures, GRS-QA represents the logical steps to the answer with reasoning graphs, where nodes are sentences and edges show logical flow.  This design allows **fine-grained analysis of LLM reasoning capabilities across various structures**, including comparison, bridge, and compositional types.  Furthermore, GRS-QA provides **comprehensive metadata** (reasoning steps, types) and **negative reasoning graphs** (structural perturbations of the positive graphs) to enable a deeper understanding of the impact of structural complexity on LLM performance. This dataset facilitates the development of new evaluation metrics, enabling a more nuanced assessment of LLM reasoning abilities beyond simple answer correctness.

#### Retrieval Analysis
The retrieval analysis section evaluates the effectiveness of three different methods (BM25, DPR, and TF-IDF) in retrieving relevant sentences for multi-hop question answering.  The results indicate that **BM25 outperforms DPR and TF-IDF**, achieving better recall and F1 scores across various question types.  This highlights the **importance of selecting an appropriate retrieval method** for optimal performance in multi-hop question answering.  While BM25 shows overall effectiveness, its performance still drops as question complexity increases, which is expected.  The study also emphasizes the **variability in retrieval performance across different question types**, suggesting the need for more nuanced approaches that consider specific reasoning structures to improve retrieval effectiveness for complex question answering scenarios.

#### LLM QA Benchmarks
The LLM QA Performance Benchmark section evaluates three LLMs (Llama-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4-mini) on question-answering tasks using GRS-QA.  **The evaluation metrics include exact match, F1 score, and LLM-as-Judge.**  The results show that **GPT-3.5 generally outperforms the other two models**, highlighting its superior reasoning capabilities.  Importantly, the study reveals a **correlation between question complexity and LLM performance**, indicating that as the reasoning complexity of the questions increases, the accuracy of the LLMs generally decreases.  This is a critical finding, demonstrating the challenges posed by GRS-QA's intricate reasoning structures for even the most advanced LLMs. The findings underline the need for further improvements in LLM reasoning capabilities, particularly when addressing complex multi-hop reasoning questions.

#### Future Directions
The paper's "Future Directions" section highlights several key areas for improvement and expansion of the GRS-QA dataset.  **Addressing the dataset's class imbalance** is crucial, potentially through synthetic data generation to better represent complex reasoning structures.  **Domain segmentation** is proposed to improve model performance in specific fields, suggesting the creation of domain-adapted models or exploration of domain-specific knowledge bases.  Further research should investigate the impact of **negative reasoning graph diversity**, potentially uncovering hidden patterns and biases in LLM reasoning. Finally, the authors encourage **benchmarking across a broader range of model architectures**, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and retrieval-augmented models, to provide a more complete understanding of which model types best handle graph-structured reasoning.  This multifaceted approach aims to enhance the robustness and generalizability of LLMs for complex reasoning tasks.

> üîº This figure displays the performance metrics of the GPT-3.5 large language model (LLM) when prompted with questions paired with negative reasoning graphs.  Negative reasoning graphs are altered versions of the ground truth reasoning graphs, introducing structural errors to isolate the impact of structure on LLM performance. The metrics shown likely include exact match accuracy, F1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall), and an LLM judge score (a measure of how well the LLM's response aligns with human judgment). The graph likely visualizes these metrics across different types of questions categorized by their reasoning graph complexity (number of reasoning steps, graph structure, etc.). This helps assess how sensitive the LLM's reasoning capabilities are to structural inaccuracies in the provided information.
