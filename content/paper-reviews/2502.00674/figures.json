(a) In MoA, multiple models respond to a query, followed by an aggregator synthesizing their outputs. (b) Self-MoA simplifies this by repeatedly sampling from a single model. (c) Self-MoA-Seq extends Self-MoA by applying a sliding window to combine the best output so far with candidate outputs. At each timestep, the synthesized output is repeated to bias the aggregator towards it, reducing the context length requirements and expanding the method\u2019s applicability. Note that MoA can extend to multiple rounds of aggregation (Appendix\u00a0A.1), while Self-MoA and Self-MoA-Seq can extend to more outputs, but we omit them here for clarity.", "description": "\uadf8\ub9bc 1\uc740 MoA, Self-MoA, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 Self-MoA-Seq\uc758 \ube44\uad50\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.
