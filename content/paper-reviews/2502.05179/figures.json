(b) Though the vanilla cascade can reduce the model size in the high resolution, its second stage still samples from Gaussian noise and only uses the first-stage results as a condition. This approach cannot effectively reduce the number of function evaluations at high resolution and still costs 571.5s (square in (d)) to generate a 1080p video. (c) In contrast, FlashVideo not only decreases the model size in the second stage but also starts sampling from the first-stage results, requiring only 4 function evaluations at high resolution while integrating a wealth of visually pleasant details, which can generate 1080P video with only 102.3s (triangle in (d)).

The 3D RoPE is employed at both stages to model the global and relative spatiotemporal distances efficiently. We construct training data pairs for Stage \\Romannum1 by randomly sampling Gaussian noise and low-resolution video latent.
