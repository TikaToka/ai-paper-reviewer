### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models by incorporating external knowledge, often extracted from documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, **OCR errors introduce noise**, affecting the quality of the knowledge base and ultimately the RAG system's performance. This paper investigates the impact of OCR errors. 



To address this issue, the researchers created OHRBench, a new benchmark dataset with carefully selected documents and questions. They identified two main types of OCR noise: semantic and formatting noise. Their experiments on various OCR solutions revealed that none consistently produces high-quality results.  **The study demonstrates the vulnerability of RAG systems to OCR noise** and explores the potential of using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as an alternative to OCR in RAG, showing promising results.

> üîº Figure 1 illustrates the creation and evaluation methodology of the OHRBench benchmark.  First, a diverse dataset of 350 unstructured PDF documents from six real-world domains is collected. Human experts then extract ground truth structured data, which is then used to generate question-answer pairs (Q&As) based on the multimodal elements within the documents (text, tables, formulas). Second, two knowledge bases are created using this ground truth data: one containing OCR-processed structured data for evaluating existing OCR systems, and another with perturbed data simulating various levels of OCR noise (semantic and formatting) to test the effects of these inaccuracies. Finally, the impact of OCR noise on each component (retrieval, generation, and overall system performance) is systematically evaluated using these knowledge bases and the generated Q&As.

### In-depth insights


#### OCR Noise Impact
The impact of OCR noise on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems is a critical concern.  **Imperfect OCR significantly degrades the quality of structured data extracted from unstructured documents**, introducing both **semantic errors** (misrecognitions of words, formulas, etc.) and **formatting errors** (issues with layout, tables, and styling).  This cascading effect negatively impacts all RAG pipeline stages: **retrieval is hampered by noisy knowledge bases resulting in irrelevant document selection**, while **generation suffers due to incoherent or inaccurate input prompts**. The analysis reveals **semantic noise has a more pervasive effect than formatting noise**, consistently degrading performance across various models and components.  Addressing this requires **improving OCR accuracy, particularly for complex layouts and multimodal elements**, and developing **RAG systems more robust to noisy inputs**, perhaps via advanced techniques like data augmentation or noise-aware training.   Investigating techniques beyond OCR, such as directly incorporating image data via vision-language models, shows promise for mitigating the problem.

#### RAG System Vulner
A hypothetical section titled "RAG System Vulnerabilities" would explore the inherent weaknesses of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.  A key vulnerability is **dependence on the quality of the retrieved information**. If the knowledge base is inaccurate, incomplete, or biased, the RAG system will produce flawed outputs, regardless of the LLM's capabilities.  **OCR errors** are a significant source of such inaccuracies, as demonstrated by the paper. The non-uniform representation of structured data further exacerbates this problem.  Another vulnerability is **sensitivity to input noise**. Minor errors in the retrieved text can significantly alter the LLM's understanding and generate incorrect or nonsensical results. Therefore, improving OCR accuracy and developing noise-robust LLMs are crucial to mitigating these vulnerabilities.  Finally,  **hallucinations** remain a concern, even with factual input. LLMs may still generate incorrect information that's not grounded in the retrieved context. Addressing RAG system vulnerabilities requires a multifaceted approach involving robust retrieval methods, improved OCR techniques, and advanced LLM architectures designed to handle noisy or incomplete data.

#### Benchmark: OHRBench
The OHRBench benchmark, designed for evaluating the cascading impact of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, presents a significant contribution. Its value stems from addressing the critical, yet often overlooked, issue of OCR noise in RAG pipelines.  **OHRBench's unique approach involves creating a dataset of unstructured PDFs across six diverse real-world domains**, each containing multimodal elements to realistically simulate challenges in OCR processing. The benchmark doesn't just evaluate the raw OCR accuracy; it goes deeper. By introducing and quantifying two types of OCR noise (semantic and formatting), **it helps researchers analyze the downstream effects of noisy data on various RAG components** including retrieval, generation, and overall performance.  This fine-grained analysis enables a more thorough understanding of where OCR errors most significantly impact RAG systems and can guide the development of more robust and noise-resilient RAG architectures.  Furthermore, OHRBench's consideration of various existing OCR solutions allows for a comprehensive comparative study, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches. **The inclusion of questions derived from these multifaceted documents ensures practical relevance**. Thus, OHRBench serves as a valuable tool for advancing the field of RAG, pushing it towards greater robustness and accuracy in the face of real-world challenges.

#### VLM-based RAG
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a compelling alternative to traditional OCR-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.  **VLMs can directly process images of documents**, bypassing the often error-prone OCR step. This significantly mitigates the cascading negative effects of OCR noise, particularly semantic and formatting errors, on retrieval and generation accuracy. While VLMs may not yet fully match the performance of high-quality OCR followed by robust RAG pipelines in all scenarios, **integrating VLMs with OCR-extracted text as complementary inputs represents a promising hybrid approach**.  This could leverage the strengths of both methods: VLMs handle complex layouts and multimodal elements well, while OCR provides precise text for situations where VLMs may struggle.  **Future research should focus on optimizing VLM architectures and training data for document understanding** to further enhance their performance in RAG applications, and investigating effective fusion strategies to combine VLM and OCR outputs for optimal results.  The potential for improved robustness and accuracy makes VLM-based or hybrid VLM/OCR RAG approaches a significant area of ongoing research.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from the paper "OCR Hinders RAG" could explore several promising avenues.  **Improving OCR robustness** is paramount; this might involve training OCR models on datasets specifically designed to mimic the complexities of real-world document layouts and multimodal elements.  Furthermore, **investigating the synergy between VLMs and OCR** is crucial.  While VLMs offer a compelling alternative to OCR in RAG, combining both approaches (leveraging OCR for textual data and VLMs for image data) could yield even more accurate and robust results.  **Developing more sophisticated noise-handling techniques for RAG** is another key area. This could involve creating novel LLM architectures that are more resilient to noisy input data or developing advanced data cleaning methods specifically designed for knowledge bases. Finally, **exploring diverse OCR solutions tailored for specific document types** within the RAG context would greatly advance the system's performance. By focusing on these directions, future research can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of RAG systems, particularly in scenarios involving complex and unstructured data.

| **Simple Prompt:** |
|---|---| 
| Please do OCR on the image and give all the text content in markdown format. The formula should be wrapped in $$ and the table should be parsed in LaTeX format. Only output the OCR results without any extra explanations or comments.| 

| **Detailed Prompt:** |
|---|---| 
| You are a powerful OCR assistant tasked with converting PDF images to Markdown format. You MUST obey the following criteria: 

1. Plain text processing: 
 - Precisely recognize all text in the PDF image without making assumptions in Markdown format. 

2. Formula Processing: 
 - Convert all formulas to LaTeX. 
 - Use $ $ to wrap inline formulas. 
 - Use $$ $$ to wrap block formulas. 

3. Table Processing: 
 - Convert tables to LaTeX. 
 - Use \begin{table} \end{table} to wrap tables. 
4. Figure Handling: 
 - Ignore figures from the PDF image; do not describe or convert images. 

5. Output Format: 
 - Ensure the Markdown output has a clear structure with appropriate line breaks. 
 - Maintain the original layout and format as closely as possible. 

Follow these guidelines strictly to ensure accurate and consistent conversion. Only output the OCR results without any extra explanations or comments.|{{< /table-caption >}}
> üîº This table presents the prompt templates used for training Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in the context of the OHRBench benchmark.  It details two prompt options: a simple prompt providing basic instructions for OCR, and a detailed prompt giving more specific directions to ensure accuracy and consistency in the extracted data.  The detailed instructions cover plain text processing, formula conversion, table parsing, and image handling, with specific formatting requirements in Markdown and LaTeX. The goal is to generate high-quality structured data for use in RAG systems.

| **System:** | You are able to mimic the various errors introduced in OCR recognition. You are given examples with ground truth and OCR results with errors. Your job is to refer to the examples and generate three samples with increasing perturbations based on the user input. |  |
|  | The new perturbed document could include the following OCR errors: |  |
|  | 1. formatting issues, character recognition errors (like misrecognized letters or numbers), and slight variations in wording. |  |
|  | 2. Redundant content and typos for plain text and formula. |  |
|  | 3. Randomly add and delete table structure controlling character '&' for tabular data. |  |
|  | 4. Randomly add extra columns and rows for tabular data. |  |
|  | 5. Randomly make misaligned columns and rows for tabular data. |  |
|  | - In the first perturbed document, make mild perturbation with 10% changes. |  |
|  | - In the second perturbed document, make moderate perturbation with 30% changes. |  |
|  | - In the third perturbed document, make severe perturbation with 50% changes. |  |
|  | Output the three perturbed documents within <response></response>. |  |
|  | You should refer to the following perturbed example to generate the perturbed document. |  |
| **Example ground truth:** | {gt_sample} |  |
| **Example results with mild perturbation:** | {mild_sample} |  |
| **Example results with moderate perturbation:** | {moderate_sample} |  |
| **Example results with severe perturbation:** | {severe_sample} |  |

> üîº This table presents the prompt template used to introduce semantic noise into the dataset.  The prompt instructs the model to mimic OCR errors (typos, misrecognized numbers/letters, slight wording variations, redundant content, table structure errors) based on provided examples of ground truth and perturbed data, generating samples with increasing levels of noise (mild, moderate, severe). The prompt includes examples of original, mildly, moderately, and severely perturbed data for reference. The goal is to create a more realistic and challenging dataset that reflects the imperfections commonly found in real-world OCR outputs.
