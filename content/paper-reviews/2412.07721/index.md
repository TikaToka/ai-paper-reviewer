### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current image-to-video generation methods struggle with precise and versatile object control, largely due to the use of 2D trajectories which often fail to capture user intent and can result in unrealistic movements. This paper introduces ObjCtrl-2.5D, a novel approach that leverages 3D trajectories (extended from 2D with depth information) and models object movement as camera movement.  This allows the use of existing camera motion control modules without retraining. 

ObjCtrl-2.5D addresses the limitations of 2D-based approaches by incorporating depth information to create more accurate 3D representations of object movement.  **The system uses a Layer Control Module to isolate the target object, ensuring independent local control**, and a **Shared Warping Latent technique to improve accuracy**. Experiments demonstrate that ObjCtrl-2.5D significantly enhances control accuracy and versatility compared to other methods, handling complex movements such as rotation.

### In-depth insights


#### 3D Trajectory Control
The concept of '3D Trajectory Control' in the context of image-to-video generation represents a significant advancement over traditional 2D methods.  **Existing 2D approaches often struggle to capture nuanced user intent**, resulting in unnatural or imprecise object movements. By incorporating depth information to extend 2D trajectories into 3D, and then representing this 3D movement as a sequence of camera poses, a more intuitive and accurate control mechanism is established.  This approach leverages the strengths of existing camera motion control models, eliminating the need for extensive retraining while achieving enhanced versatility.  **The key is the transformation of the spatial trajectory into camera poses**, which directly addresses the limitations of 2D methods.  This transformation is crucial because it allows the system to naturally control object movement in three dimensions, leading to more realistic and engaging video outputs.  Furthermore, techniques like the Layer Control Module (LCM) and Shared Warping Latents (SWL) are pivotal in ensuring precise and targeted control without interfering with the background and ensuring the object movement remains accurate over time.

#### Training-Free Method
The core concept of a "Training-Free Method" in the context of this research paper is the ability to achieve precise object control within video generation **without the need for any additional training** of the underlying model.  This is a significant departure from many existing approaches that require extensive training data for object manipulation. The paper proposes a novel method that leverages existing camera motion control models, thereby bypassing the usual training phase.  The focus shifts to cleverly adapting existing models to the task, rather than creating new ones, **resulting in significant computational cost savings and increased efficiency**. By representing object motion as camera poses, the method exploits the inherent capabilities of existing camera control mechanisms, making this approach both innovative and practical.  A key element is the extension of 2D trajectories to 3D using depth information, adding another layer of realism and control.  The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through rigorous experimentation and comparison against both training-free and training-based alternatives.  This approach highlights the potential to reduce reliance on large training datasets while still achieving high-quality results and versatile object control.

#### Camera Pose Control
Camera pose control, in the context of image-to-video generation, offers a powerful approach to manipulating object motion.  Instead of relying on less precise 2D trajectory inputs, **using camera poses directly provides a more intuitive and accurate means of specifying 3D object movement.**  This is because camera poses inherently encapsulate 3D spatial information, including both position and orientation.  A method leveraging camera poses allows for the creation of nuanced animations, capturing both translational and rotational object movement with greater fidelity. **The choice to represent object motion via camera poses significantly enhances the controllability and realism of generated videos.** Moreover, **training-free object control via camera pose manipulation simplifies the pipeline, avoiding the need for extensive training datasets or complex models specifically tailored for object motion.** By utilizing pre-trained camera motion control modules, this approach offers a computationally efficient and versatile solution for complex object movements in I2V generation.

#### Ablation Study Results
An ablation study systematically removes components of a model to assess their individual contributions.  In this context, an ablation study on a video generation model with object control would likely evaluate the impact of removing key modules, such as **the depth estimation module**, **the layer control module**, or the **shared warping latent module**. Removing the depth estimation would test the model's performance solely on 2D trajectories. Removing the layer control module would assess how well the model isolates the target object for motion control without separating foreground and background. Finally, removing the shared warping latent module would test whether this feature significantly improves object control precision.  The ablation study would likely quantify these effects using standard metrics like FID and FVD to evaluate video quality and ObjMC to measure the accuracy of object trajectory following.  **The results would demonstrate the relative importance of each module**, providing valuable insights into the model's architecture and the effectiveness of its design choices.  Significant performance drops when removing certain components would highlight their crucial role in achieving high-quality, controllable video generation.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this work on ObjCtrl-2.5D could involve several key improvements.  **Extending the approach to handle more complex 3D geometries and object interactions** would be crucial; the current method simplifies 3D object motion as camera translation. Incorporating object rotation and more nuanced interactions (collisions, occlusions) presents a significant challenge.  Another avenue is **enhancing the robustness of the system to handle more complex scenes and varied object appearances**. The current method relies on readily extractable object masks; adapting it to more challenging visual scenarios would significantly improve its generalizability. **Improving the efficiency and scalability of the approach** is also important; the current implementation requires depth estimation and other computationally intensive steps.  Finally, **exploring alternative control mechanisms beyond trajectories and camera poses** (e.g., natural language descriptions or sketches) would make the system more user-friendly and accessible to a wider range of users.  Addressing these aspects would lead to a more versatile and powerful object control system in the context of image-to-video generation.

> üîº ObjCtrl-2.5D uses a 2D trajectory and depth information from an image to create a 3D trajectory.  This 3D trajectory is converted into camera poses using Algorithm 1.  To control object movement within an existing camera motion control module, a Layer Control Module (LCM) separates the object and background using distinct camera poses.  A camera encoder extracts features from these poses, which are then spatially combined using scale-wise masks by the LCM. Finally, a Shared Warping Latent (SWL) technique improves control accuracy by sharing low-frequency noise across frames within the object's warped region.

The object's movement from one point to the next in the 3D trajectory is represented by a camera translation.  The rotation of the camera is not considered, thus simplifying the transformation. This process leverages triangulation to map points in the 3D trajectory to camera positions, thereby enabling control of object motion using an existing camera motion control model. Algorithm 1 provides the detailed pseudocode for this transformation.

> üîº This figure compares the object control capabilities of ObjCtrl-2.5D against two other training-free methods, PEEKABOO and FreeTraj.  PEEKABOO and FreeTraj use 2D trajectories and bounding boxes to control object movement, resulting in less precise control and alignment with the intended trajectory. ObjCtrl-2.5D, however, improves accuracy by expanding the 2D trajectory into 3D using depth information, and then converting the 3D trajectory into camera poses using a geometric projection (triangulation).  This allows for more precise control and better alignment of the object's movement to the desired trajectory.

> üîº This figure compares the object control capabilities of ObjCtrl-2.5D with two training-based methods: DragAnything and DragNUWA.  The comparison highlights how the training strategies of the existing methods lead to less precise and less versatile object control.  DragAnything applies global movement, unintentionally affecting all objects, even when only one object's movement is specified.  DragNUWA often only moves a portion of the targeted object. In contrast, ObjCtrl-2.5D, with its Layer Control Module, demonstrates precise and targeted control, even when the trajectory involves complex movements like front-to-back-to-front motion (as indicated by the green point).  This shows the superior versatility of ObjCtrl-2.5D.

In contrast, our proposed ObjCtrl-2.5D achieves precise, targeted object control thanks to its Layer Control Module. Additionally, ObjCtrl-2.5D is capable of performing more versatile object control when given a trajectory with a fixed spatial position (the green point in the second sample), such as front-to-back-to-front movement, while DragAnything¬†[58] generates a relatively static video.
