(Principle (2): Factual and Thus Y = X + Z, Z ~ N(0,1), Z is independent of X, and E(Y)2 ≤ 2. Find the channel capacity in bits. Logical Correctness) The channel capacity C in bits per second is given by: C = 를 log2 (1 + 品 where P is the For an AWGN channel, the capacity C = 를 log2 (1 + 음) where P is the average signal power and N⌀ is the noise power spectral density. For this problem, we have signal power and N is the noise power. From the power constraint, E(Y2) ≤ 2. Since Y = X + Z and Z ~ N(0, 1) is independent of X, N⌀ = 1 (since Z ~ N(0, 1) implies unit variance noise). Given the average output power E(Y2) = E((X + Z)2) = E(X2) + E(Z2) = P + 1 ≤ 2 ⇒ P ≤ 1. P = 2, the formula becomes: C = 를log2(1 + 2) = 를10g2(3). Using the change of base The noise Z is Gaussian with N(0, 1), so N = 1. Plugging into the capacity log10(3) 0.4771 Plugging this back into the capacity formula: C = 를 log2 (1+ 를) = 를 10g2(2) = 0.5. Therefore, the channel formula, log2(3) = N n 1.585. formula, log10(2) 0.3010 ⌀= 를 X 1.585 u 0.7925. Therefore, the channel capacity is approximately 0.7925 bits. capacity is 0.5 bits.</td></tr></table>
