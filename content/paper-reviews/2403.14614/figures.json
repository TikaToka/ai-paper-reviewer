The images are obtained from LOL-v1\u00a0[64], SOTS\u00a0[32], Rain100L\u00a0[32], GoPro\u00a0[44], and BSD68\u00a0[41], respectively.\nRight, the sub-graph illustrates the mean values of Fourier spectra on the square of length shown on the x-axis, across five tasks. The spectra are all resized to 320\u00d7320320320320\\times 320320 \u00d7 320 for comparisons. As seen, different tasks pay different attention to different frequency subbands. For example, there are larger discrepancies in low frequency between degraded and target image pairs of the low-light image enhancement and dehazing datasets. In contrast, the frequency differences are generally evenly distributed for image denoising.", "description": "\uadf8\ub9bc 1\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubcf5\uc6d0 \uc791\uc5c5(\uc800\uc870\ub3c4 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud5a5\uc0c1, \ub514\ud5e4\uc774\uc9d5, \ub514\ub808\uc774\ub2dd, \ubaa8\uc158 \ud750\ub9bc \uc81c\uac70, \uc7a1\uc74c \uc81c\uac70)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub4e4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc67c\ucabd\uc5d0\ub294 \uac01 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc800\ud654\uc9c8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0, \uc815\ub2f5 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc800\ud654\uc9c8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ub2f5 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \ube80 \uc794\ucc28 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \ud478\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc774 \uc704\uc5d0\uc11c\ubd80\ud130 \uc544\ub798\ub85c \uc21c\uc11c\ub300\ub85c \ub098\uc5f4\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub4e4\uc740 \uac01\uac01 LOL-v1, SOTS, Rain100L, GoPro, BSD68 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc838\uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc624\ub978\ucabd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub294 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ud478\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0\uac12\uc744 x\ucd95\uc5d0 \ud45c\uc2dc\ub41c \uae38\uc774\uc758 \uc81c\uacf1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc740 \ube44\uad50\ub97c \uc704\ud574 320x320 \ud06c\uae30\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc791\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc774 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \ub300\uc5ed\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc815\ub3c4\ub85c \uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \uae30\uc6b8\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc54c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, \uc800\uc870\ub3c4 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \ubc0f \ub514\ud5e4\uc774\uc9d5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc800\ud654\uc9c8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc640 \uc815\ub2f5 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uac04 \uc800\uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc28\uc774\uac00 \ub354 \ud07d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74, \uc7a1\uc74c \uc81c\uac70\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \ucc28\uc774\ub294 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ub974\uac8c \ubd84\ud3ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2403.14614/x14.png", "caption": "Figure 2: The t-SNE results of intermediate features produced by the three-task all-in-one models.
