### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current AI agent systems struggle with balancing generalization (handling diverse tasks) and specialization (mastering specific tasks).  Existing methods using single generalist or specialized agents often fall short in real-world scenarios involving open-ended computer tasks that require a combination of both skills.  This creates a need for flexible and scalable systems that can dynamically integrate diverse agents.

AgentStore is proposed as a solution; it leverages a novel MetaAgent with the AgentToken strategy to efficiently manage and utilize a wide range of heterogeneous agents.  The systemâ€™s scalability is showcased by dynamically integrating third-party agents, adapting to evolving OS environments.  Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentStore's superior performance, significantly improving upon existing methods by doubling previous success rates. This highlights the importance of AgentStore's adaptable architecture for addressing the challenges of open-ended tasks in real-world environments.
