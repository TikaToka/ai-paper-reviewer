When task-related objects\nin the input to the VLM are occluded, the unique features of these\nobjects are also obscured, leading to significant changes in the\ncorresponding VLM output. In contrast, the features of other\nobjects, which are not fully occluded, show only minor changes in\nthe VLM output. We leverage this observation to assess the\ncorrectness of the generated instance-specific prompts without the\nneed for ground truth. By progressive negative mining, we iteratively\ncorrect difficult-to-identify erroneous prompts.\n(b) Evaluation of INT. CLIP semantic similarities are compared between\nthe instance-specific prompts INT generated and the ground\ntruth.
