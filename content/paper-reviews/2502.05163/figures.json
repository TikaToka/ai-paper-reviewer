A skewed distribution toward 0 for false negatives and toward 1 for false positives indicates higher classifier confidence in its incorrect predictions. Analysis across the four French datasets reveals that the classifier exhibits significant confidence in its false predictions.", "description": "\uadf8\ub9bc 9\ub294 \uc2dc\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uc758 \uc624\ud0d0\uacfc \ubbf8\ud0d0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd9c\ub825 \ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc624\ud0d0\uc740 1\uc5d0 \uce58\uc6b0\uccd0 \uc788\uace0 \ubbf8\ud0d0\uc740 0\uc5d0 \uce58\uc6b0\uccd0 \uc788\ub294 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \ubd84\ud3ec\ub294 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uac00 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ud655\uc2e0\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub124 \uac1c\uc758 \ud504\ub791\uc2a4\uc5b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc, \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub294 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ud655\uc2e0\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc2dc\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub098 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "section": "6.2 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130"}]
