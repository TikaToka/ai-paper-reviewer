### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many existing studies use simple instructions to train embodied AI agents, neglecting the richness and diversity of human communication. This paper addresses this gap by investigating how different types of language informativeness (feedback on past behaviors and future guidance) and diversity (variation in language expressions) affect agent learning.  The study highlights a critical limitation in current AI training methods and points to improvements needed for more natural and effective human-AI interactions. 



The researchers used Decision Transformer (DT), a popular offline RL model, and created a new Language-Teachable DT (LTDT) that incorporates diverse and informative language feedback.  They found that agents trained with diverse and informative language significantly outperformed those trained with simple instructions or no language at all.  Specifically, combining hindsight (feedback on past mistakes) and foresight (guidance for future actions) proved especially beneficial.  This work introduces a novel, human-centered approach to AI training that leads to more robust and adaptable agents, and provides a valuable framework for future research in this field.

### In-depth insights


#### Language Teachability
The research explores the concept of 'Language Teachability' within the context of embodied reinforcement learning agents.  It investigates how the **informativeness** (hindsight and foresight feedback) and **diversity** of language instructions impact an agent's learning and adaptation. The study reveals that agents trained with diverse and informative language feedback exhibit significantly improved performance and generalization compared to agents trained with simpler instructions or no language at all.  **Combining hindsight and foresight feedback is particularly beneficial**, enhancing the agent's understanding of both past mistakes and future guidance. Furthermore, the use of a GPT-augmented language pool to increase diversity leads to even better results. This highlights the crucial role of rich, human-like language in teaching embodied agents complex tasks, offering a promising avenue for enhancing their learning efficiency and robustness in open-world scenarios.

#### RL Agent Training
The research explores offline reinforcement learning (RL) agent training using diverse and informative language feedback.  **Decision Transformer (DT)** serves as the backbone architecture, extended to a multi-modal Language-Teachable DT (LTDT).  Training leverages expert agent trajectories and hand-crafted language templates augmented with GPT-4 for diversity.  **Informativeness** is controlled through hindsight (feedback on past actions) and foresight (guidance for future actions). The study demonstrates that agents trained with diverse and informative language significantly outperform those trained with simple instructions or no language. **Enhanced generalization and rapid adaptation to new tasks** are observed as key benefits of this approach, highlighting the importance of rich language in embodied agent learning.

#### Diverse Language
The research explores the impact of diverse language on embodied reinforcement learning agents.  It finds that **training agents with diverse language significantly improves performance**, surpassing models trained with only simple, repetitive instructions or no language at all.  This enhanced performance stems from the agents' improved ability to generalize and adapt to new, unseen tasks.  The study leverages GPT-4 to augment hand-crafted language templates, generating a wider range of expressions for the same instruction, thus creating a richer learning experience.  **Diversity in language, therefore, acts as a crucial factor in facilitating a more robust and adaptable agent.** The results consistently demonstrate the importance of moving beyond simple instruction sets to encompass the nuanced and varied nature of human communication in training these AI agents.  This richer language input allows for better generalization and faster adaptation to new scenarios, highlighting the pivotal role of natural language use in teaching embodied agents.  The findings suggest that **future research should focus on creating more realistic and complex language interactions**, rather than relying on simplistic instructions, to unlock the full potential of language-guided reinforcement learning.

#### Informative Feedback
The research explores the impact of informative language feedback on embodied reinforcement learning agents.  **Hindsight feedback**, commenting on past actions, and **foresight feedback**, guiding future actions, are investigated.  Results show that agents trained with both types of feedback significantly outperform those trained with only one or no feedback. **Combining hindsight and foresight proved particularly effective**, enhancing generalization and adaptability to novel tasks.  The study highlights the importance of rich, informative language feedback in training embodied agents, moving beyond simple instructions towards more nuanced and human-like communication strategies for improved performance.  **Diversity in language expression**, also explored, further boosted agent performance, emphasizing the value of varied phrasing in teaching complex tasks.

#### Future Research
Future research directions identified in the paper include extending the work to more realistic and complex environments that incorporate real-world visual inputs and challenges.  The authors plan to evaluate agents in settings that involve real-life visual inputs and challenges beyond simulated game-based environments.  **Addressing the limitations of current language models** is also a priority, aiming to incorporate a broader spectrum of language variations and test agents in scenarios involving more diverse linguistic inputs to capture nuances like idioms and dialects missed by current models.  **Ethical considerations** are highlighted, suggesting future work to ensure that the teachable nature of the AI agents promotes safer and more ethical interactions.  Investigating the influence of language frequency on agent performance is another suggested area of future research.  Finally, the authors aim to **expand on multi-turn human-machine dialogues** by refining the current system to create more realistic and natural interactions.

> üîº This figure illustrates the process of generating both hindsight and foresight language feedback within a reinforcement learning framework.  An agent (œÄ) interacts with an environment, taking actions.  Simultaneously, an expert agent (œÄ*) with complete knowledge of the environment's state generates feedback based on the agent's actions. Hindsight feedback comments on the agent's past action at time t-1, by comparing it to the expert agent's corresponding action at t-1. Foresight feedback, on the other hand, guides the agent's future action at time t by suggesting an action based on the expert agent's action at time t. To enhance the diversity of feedback, the system employs a pool of GPT-augmented language templates, randomly selecting one to deliver instructions.

The performance is evaluated under different conditions of language feedback: no language, only foresight language, only hindsight language, both hindsight and foresight using hand-crafted templates, and finally both hindsight and foresight using GPT-augmented language templates.  The results demonstrate that agents trained with increasingly more informative language feedback (hindsight and foresight being most informative) achieve higher performance. Furthermore, when comparing agents with the same level of informativeness (hindsight + foresight), the agents trained with the diverse GPT-generated language templates significantly outperformed those trained with hand-crafted templates, highlighting the positive impact of language diversity on agent learning.

The x-axis represents the number of shots (5, 10, or 20) provided during the adaptation phase, and the y-axis indicates the average reward achieved. The results clearly demonstrate that pre-training with more informative language (hindsight and foresight) leads to significantly better adaptation performance on unseen tasks, outperforming agents trained with less informative feedback.

> üîº This figure shows the relationship between task difficulty and the efficiency gain achieved by using language feedback in reinforcement learning.  The x-axis represents task difficulty, with easier tasks on the left and harder tasks on the right. Task difficulty is measured by the success rate of agents *without* language feedback.  The y-axis shows the efficiency gain, which is calculated as the difference in efficiency between agents trained *with* informative and diverse language feedback and agents trained *without* any language feedback. Efficiency is measured by a path-weighted reward. The plot shows that the efficiency gain increases initially as task difficulty rises, reaching a peak at a moderate level of difficulty.  Beyond that moderate point, the efficiency gain begins to decrease as tasks become harder. This suggests that language feedback is most beneficial for tasks of moderate difficulty.  For very easy tasks, language feedback provides little additional benefit, and for very hard tasks, the challenges may be too significant for language feedback to substantially improve performance.

> <summary>read the caption</summary>
> Figure 6: Efficiency gain vs. task difficulty. We fit the scatter plots with a second-degree polynomial to visualize the overall trend. As task difficulty increases, the general trend of the efficiency gain is to rise initially and then decline, suggesting: (1) for tasks that are too easy or too hard, language feedback does not improve efficiency; (2) language feedback is most helpful in increasing efficiency for moderate tasks.

> üîº This figure displays the results of an experiment comparing the performance of reinforcement learning agents trained with varying frequencies of language feedback. The x-axis represents the percentage of timesteps during training where language feedback was provided, ranging from 0% to 100%. The y-axis represents the average reward achieved by the agents across four different environments (HomeGrid, ALFWorld, Messenger, and MetaWorld).  The graph shows a positive correlation between language feedback frequency and agent performance across all four environments, indicating that more frequent feedback leads to better learning outcomes.  The results suggest that continuous interaction and guidance, through frequent language feedback, significantly benefits the learning process of embodied reinforcement learning agents.

Two scenarios are considered: (1) no language feedback is provided during evaluation and (2) at each step, disturbed language feedback is given. The results demonstrate that agents trained with GPT-augmented language consistently outperform agents trained without any language, even when dealing with disturbed feedback.  Interestingly, in some environments, the GPT-augmented agents still perform better even when no feedback is given, highlighting the robustness and effectiveness of this language training approach.

The experiment compared the performance of agents trained with varying degrees of informativeness and diversity in their language feedback, showing that agents trained with more diverse and informative language (both foresight and hindsight) perform significantly better than those trained without language.  The graph shows reward performance for agents trained under four language conditions: no language, GPT-augmented hindsight only, GPT-augmented foresight only, and GPT-augmented hindsight and foresight together. The combined hindsight and foresight training results in the best performance, highlighting the importance of both types of feedback for improving agents' ability to learn and perform the task.

These parameters include those related to the transformer network itself (e.g., number of layers, attention heads, embedding dimension), the training process (e.g., batch size, learning rate, optimizer), and regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, weight decay).  The specific values chosen for each hyperparameter are crucial for the model's performance and generalization ability on the MetaWorld tasks.
