### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current research on Android autonomous agents suffers from a **lack of systematic evaluation** across open-source and closed-source models and a **lack of standardized benchmarks**. Existing benchmarks often use static environments or lack comprehensive evaluation metrics. This limits the ability to analyze model behavior, conduct reinforcement learning experiments, and compare different approaches effectively.



This paper introduces ANDROIDLAB, a novel Android agent framework designed to address these limitations. ANDROIDLAB offers a **reproducible benchmark with 138 tasks across nine apps**, supporting both LLMs and LMMs.  It uses a unified action space and introduces new evaluation metrics to measure operational efficiency.  By utilizing ANDROIDLAB, the authors develop an Android Instruction dataset and fine-tune six open-source models, resulting in **significant improvements in success rates**. The framework and dataset are publicly available, paving the way for more systematic and comparative research in this domain.

### In-depth insights


#### Android Agent Benchmarks
The research paper reveals a critical gap in systematic benchmarking for Android autonomous agents.  Existing benchmarks are limited by static environments and lack of open-source model evaluation, hindering progress in the field.  **ANDROIDLAB** is introduced as a novel framework addressing these limitations.  It provides a standardized operational environment encompassing diverse modalities, a challenging benchmark with 138 tasks across nine apps, and an instruction dataset to facilitate training. Notably, **ANDROIDLAB** enables fair comparison of both open-source and closed-source models, offering valuable insights into their performance and highlighting the potential for improving open-source solutions through systematic evaluation.  The results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source models significantly boosts performance, narrowing the gap against their closed-source counterparts, though the latter still hold an edge in overall efficiency and success rates.  The study's impact lies in establishing a **reproducible and challenging benchmark** that accelerates Android autonomous agent research.

#### Multimodal Android Actions
The research paper section on 'Multimodal Android Actions' delves into the methods for enabling autonomous agents to interact with Android devices using multiple modalities.  It highlights the **design of a unified action space** that seamlessly supports both large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs). This design is crucial for enabling fair comparisons between different model types.  The core of this approach lies in **defining basic operation modes**, including XML mode for text-only LLMs and SoM mode for LMMs which processes visual information.  These modes, along with ReAct and SeeAct frameworks, provide flexibility in agent interaction strategies. The paper emphasizes the importance of a **standardized action space** to ensure fair comparisons and the **creation of a benchmark dataset** containing predefined tasks across various apps to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of different models. The framework presented enables a comprehensive evaluation of various model architectures' success rates in executing complex tasks on the Android system. The approach facilitates systematic analysis of model behavior and promotes the development of enhanced Android-compatible autonomous agents.

#### Instruction Dataset
The research paper introduces the Android Instruction dataset, **a crucial component for training and evaluating Android agents**. This dataset was meticulously constructed using a three-step process: task derivation and expansion, self-exploration, and manual annotation.  **Self-exploration leveraged LLMs and LMMs to automatically generate task traces**, while manual annotation ensured accuracy and addressed challenges in data collection, particularly concerning dynamic UI elements.  The dataset comprises **10.5k traces and 94.3k steps**, with a focus on real-world scenarios and reproducibility.  **It includes tasks, phone screen states, and XML information**, offering a comprehensive and detailed record of Android agent interactions.  This dataset's use in fine-tuning open-source LLMs and LMMs resulted in significant performance improvements, showcasing its value in bridging the gap between open-source and closed-source models for Android agent development.

#### Open-Source Model Gains
The research reveals significant progress in open-source Android agent models.  **Fine-tuning with the AndroidInstruct dataset substantially improved performance**, increasing success rates for LLMs from 4.59% to 21.50% and for LMMs from 1.93% to 13.28%. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the dataset and highlights the potential of open-source models to reach levels comparable to their closed-source counterparts.  While closed-source models like GPT-4 maintained higher success rates, the substantial gains in open-source models emphasize the **achievable improvements through effective training data and methods**.  This finding suggests a promising path for bridging the performance gap between open and closed-source models and fostering further development in this area.

Task derivation and expansion uses existing academic datasets and manual instruction writing to seed the generation of tasks. Self-exploration employs LLMs and LMMs to automatically explore the Android apps, collecting traces of operations. Finally, manual annotation involves instruction checking by annotators to assess task feasibility, preliminary familiarization with the app interface, the execution of tasks and recording their traces, and cross-verification by a second annotator to ensure data accuracy. The collected data includes tasks, phone screen states, XML information, and operations.

> üîº This table compares the performance of different multi-modal instruction tuning methods.  The experiment uses the same training data across all methods, but only the 'Set of Mask' index is added to the SoM (Set of Mask) mode. Importantly, the caption notes a limitation of the AITW (Android In The Wild) dataset, which only provides point coordinates instead of accurate bounding boxes (bbox), making it a more challenging dataset. CogVLM2 serves as the base model for all experiments. The results are presented in terms of SR (Success Rate), Sub-SR (Sub-Goal Success Rate), RRR (Reversed Redundancy Ratio), and ROR (Reasonable Operation Ratio) for both BBOX (Bounding Box) and SoM modes.

> Table 7: Different multi-modal modes of instruction tuning. We use the same set of training data but only add a set-of-mask index on SoM mode. Note that AITW dataset even could not provide accurate bbox, but only point. We use CogVLM2 as base model.

> üîº This table presents the results of experiments evaluating the impact of the ReAct and SeeAct frameworks on model performance.  It shows the success rate (SR), sub-goal success rate (Sub-SR), reversed redundancy ratio (RRR), and reasonable operation ratio (ROR) for GPT-40 and Gemini-1.5-Pro models across different modes (XML, XML+ReAct, XML+SeeAct, SoM, SoM+ReAct, SoM+SeeAct). The results highlight a significant improvement in model performance, particularly in the XML+ReAct mode, demonstrating the effectiveness of the ReAct framework in enhancing agent capabilities.
