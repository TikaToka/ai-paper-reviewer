Complete the current step according to the operation in the video. |  |\n| Please output your thought about this step by step before you output your response. |  |", "caption": "Table 6: The prompt for deep-reflection agent.", "description": "\ubcf8 \ud45c\ub294 \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 \uae4a\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ubc18\ucd94 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(Deep-Reflection Agent)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8(\uba85\ub839\uc5b4)\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc640 \uc7a5\uce58\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc644\ub8cc\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub418\ub294 \uba85\ub839\uc5b4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \uc774 \ud45c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \uc785\ub825\uac12(\ube44\ub514\uc624, \ud604\uc7ac \ud654\uba74, \uc774\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc815\ubcf4 \ub4f1)\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0,  \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubc18\uc751\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc0c1\uc138\ud788 \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uae4a\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ubc18\ucd94 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\uace0, \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "section": "3.5 Deep-Reflection Agent"}, {"content": "| System | User |\n|---|---| \n| You are a mobile phone operation assistant.

The second image is two screenshots before and after an operation from the user. The user want to complete the task: $I_{u}$. Please note that these two images are not necessarily the complete operation trajectories, they may only be part of the continuous operation. | Here are the video and operation: <br> <img src=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2502.17110/V_w.png\"><img src=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2502.17110/D_i.png\"> |\n| Although the task shown in the video may not be exactly the same as the task the user needs to complete, there is a strong correlation between the two. So the user is referring to the operation in the video to complete this task. |  |\n| Now you need to determine which frame of the video the user is in after the device is operated. You need to use a number to represent it. If the device is in the state between two frames, the previous frame is output. |  |\n| If the device is not in any frame of the video, please output the number 0 to indicate an operation error and generate an error cause analysis. |  |\n| You need to output in the following json format: |  |\n| {\"Thought\": Your thought of current question, \"Frame\": a number, \"Analysis\": If Frame is 0, generate an error cause analysis, otherwise output null, \"Need_Back\": If Frame is 0, you need to think about how to get back on track.
