The vertical axis indicates performance in the Jeopardy setting at different compute budgets and confidence thresholds. The color indicates the proportion of questions that are answered; in redder regions, the model is more likely answer, whereas in bluer regions the model is less likely to answer. The horizontal plane divides positive and negative utility regions of the operating curve. The checkered lines indicate the threshold slices that we compare against R1-32B in Figure\u00a05. Note the relatively lower volume above the break-even point of 0 corresponds to s1-32B\u2019s broadly inferior performance at these odds.", "description": "\uadf8\ub9bc 8\uc740 s1-32B \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc81c\ud37c\ub514 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc6a9 \ud568\uc218 \ud45c\uba74\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc138\ub85c\ucd95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5f0\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9 \ubc0f \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \uc0c9\uc0c1\uc740 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube68\uac04\uc0c9 \uc601\uc5ed\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc751\ub2f5\ud560 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc74c\uc744, \ud30c\ub780\uc0c9 \uc601\uc5ed\uc740 \uc751\ub2f5\ud560 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub0ae\uc74c\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc218\ud3c9\uc120\uc740 \uc591\uc758 \ud6a8\uc6a9 \uc601\uc5ed\uacfc \uc74c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc6a9 \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \uad6c\ubd84\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccb4\ud06c\ubb34\ub2ac \uc120\uc740 \uadf8\ub9bc 5\uc5d0\uc11c R1-32B \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c \uc784\uacc4\uac12 \uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. 0 \uc9c0\uc810 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub0ae\uc740 \ubd80\ud53c\ub294 s1-32B \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f4\ub4f1\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "section": "4 Utility"}]
