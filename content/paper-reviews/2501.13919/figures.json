In localized TPO (upper-left), we generate queries focused on short segments, with contrastive responses that retain or exclude the target segment. For comprehensive TPO (lower-left), queries are designed for high-level understanding, using intact video versus sparse downsampled video for contrasting responses. After post-filtering, the contrast response pairs are serving as the preference dataset to train a video-LMM, guiding the model to prioritize preferred responses for improved video understanding.", "description": "\uadf8\ub9bc 1\uc740 \ube44\ub514\uc624-LMM\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc774\ud574 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc790\uae30 \uac1c\uc120 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\uc220\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(TPO)\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.
