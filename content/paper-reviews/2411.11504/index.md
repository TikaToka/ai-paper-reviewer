### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Foundation models, while powerful, face challenges in effective supervision for capability enhancement.  Traditional data-centric approaches are costly and unsustainable.  This necessitates exploration of novel supervision methods.  The limitations of handcrafted features and the increasing cost of human annotation highlight the need for more automated, scalable approaches to improving model performance.

This paper introduces "verifier engineering," a novel post-training paradigm that uses automated verifiers for verification tasks. This process is systematically categorized into three essential stages: search, verify, and feedback.  The paper reviews state-of-the-art research within each stage, demonstrating that verifier engineering can enhance model capabilities by providing more effective supervision signals than traditional methods.  It offers a unified framework covering various approaches, potentially paving the way for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

### In-depth insights


#### Verifier Engineering
Verifier engineering presents a novel post-training paradigm for foundation models, addressing the challenges of providing effective supervision.  It leverages automated verifiers to perform verification tasks, providing meaningful feedback to enhance model capabilities.  This approach systematically categorizes the process into three stages: **search**, **verify**, and **feedback**. The search stage focuses on generating candidate responses, while the verify stage evaluates these responses using a suite of verifiers.  Feedback, the final stage, uses the verification results to refine model output distribution via methods like supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. Verifier engineering offers a fundamental shift from traditional data engineering, potentially leading to a more efficient and cost-effective way to improve foundation models and paving a path toward Artificial General Intelligence.  **Its key innovation lies in replacing expensive, time-consuming human evaluation with automated verification**, enabling scalability and broader application.  However, effective implementation requires addressing challenges like balancing exploration and exploitation during search, designing robust and diverse verifiers, and developing efficient strategies for feedback integration.  The effectiveness of this approach ultimately hinges on the quality and diversity of the verifiers employed, as well as the ability of the feedback mechanisms to improve the model's generalization capabilities.

#### Search Strategies
Effective search strategies are crucial for efficient verifier engineering.  **Linear search**, proceeding sequentially, is computationally inexpensive but risks early errors.  **Tree search**, exploring multiple paths concurrently, offers greater potential but demands more resources.  The choice depends on the task complexity and computational budget. **Balancing exploration and exploitation** is key; excessive exploration wastes resources while excessive exploitation limits discovery of optimal solutions.  Therefore, advanced techniques like beam search and Monte Carlo Tree Search, which strategically balance exploration and exploitation, are particularly valuable.  **Goal-aware search** further enhances efficiency by directly incorporating the desired outcome into the search process, prioritizing paths more likely to achieve the verification goal.  Ultimately, the selection of a search strategy should be tailored to the specific application, balancing computational cost against the need to thoroughly explore the solution space.

#### Verifier Taxonomy
A robust verifier taxonomy is crucial for advancing verifier engineering.  **Categorizing verifiers** based on various criteria like verification form (binary, score, ranking, text), granularity (token, thought, trajectory), source (program-based, model-based), and training requirements (yes/no) allows for a systematic understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.  **This multifaceted approach** enables researchers to select optimal verifiers for specific tasks and to design effective combinations. The taxonomy highlights **trade-offs between accuracy and generalization**: program-based verifiers offer deterministic outputs but lack flexibility, while model-based verifiers are adaptable but introduce uncertainty.  **Further research** should explore the development of new verifier types and combinations to address limitations and to enhance the overall efficiency and robustness of the verifier engineering pipeline. **The taxonomy serves as a foundational tool** for evaluating existing methods, guiding future research directions, and ultimately contributing to the creation of more powerful and reliable foundation models.

#### Feedback Methods
Feedback methods in post-training of foundation models are crucial for optimizing model capabilities. The paper explores two primary approaches: **training-based feedback**, which involves updating model parameters using data efficiently obtained through searching and verifying, and **inference-based feedback**, which modifies the output distribution without changing model parameters.  Training-based feedback encompasses imitation learning, preference learning, and reinforcement learning, each leveraging verification results in different ways.  **Imitation learning** directly uses verified high-quality data to fine-tune the model.  **Preference learning** uses pairwise comparisons of candidate responses, ranked by verifiers, to optimize model preferences.  **Reinforcement learning** utilizes reward signals from verifiers to guide iterative model improvements. Inference-based feedback is further categorized into **verifier-guided** and **verifier-aware** methods. Verifier-guided methods select outputs without direct model interaction, while verifier-aware methods directly incorporate feedback into model operations.  The choice of feedback method depends on factors like robustness to noise, impact on model capabilities, and cross-query generalization.  Finding a balance between exploration and exploitation during feedback is key to avoiding both under- and over-optimization. The paper emphasizes the need for careful verifier design, efficient search, and robust evaluation methods to maximize the impact of the feedback process.  **Systematically evaluating feedback approaches** remains a challenge; thus, further research is needed to optimize these methods for achieving Artificial General Intelligence.

#### Future Challenges
Future research in verifier engineering faces several key challenges.  **Improving search efficiency** is crucial, as exhaustive searches are computationally expensive.  More sophisticated methods are needed to balance exploration and exploitation effectively.  **Developing robust and versatile verifiers** is another major challenge.  Creating a system that seamlessly integrates multiple verifiers with diverse capabilities and handles conflicting verification results remains an open problem. **Designing effective feedback mechanisms** is critical for maximizing the impact of verification on model performance.  The optimal approach must balance online and offline feedback strategies, consider the model's capacity, and ensure effective generalization to unseen data.  **Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach** that incorporates elements of machine learning, software engineering, and human-computer interaction, ultimately aiming to create robust, reliable and efficient verifier engineering techniques for the enhancement of foundation models.
