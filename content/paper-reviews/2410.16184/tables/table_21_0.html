Thus, -1 ≤ x ≤ 1... We need to find values of x such that arccos(x2) does not equal � /2 + k�. Solving arccos(x2) = �/2, we get x2 = 0, so x = 0. The function f(x) is defined for all x in the interval [-1,1] except x = 0.

The function arccos(x2) is defined when -1 ≤ x2 ≤ 1, which simplifies to 0 ≤ x2 ≤ 1. · To avoid arccos(x2) = �/2, we must have x2 + 1. Therefore, x must be in the interval [-1,1) or (-1, 1].

Domain of arccos(x2): The function arccos(x2) is defined when -1 ≤ x2 ≤ 1. Combining the domains: We need to find the values of x such that arccos(x2) does not equal �/2 + k�. Solving arccos(x2) = �/2, we get x2 = cos(�/2) = 0. Thus, x = 0 is the only value that makes arccos(x2) = �/2. The func- tion f(x) is defined for all x in the interval [-1,1] except x = 0. Therefore, the domain of f(x) is [-1,0)U(0, 1].</td><td>To find the domain of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)), we need to determine the values of x for which the function is defined. Range of arccos(x2): The function arccos(x2) will return values in the interval [0, �/2].. . Domain of tan(�): The function tan(0) is defined for all 0 except 0 = �/2 + k� for any integer k. Combining the con- ditions:We need to ensure that arccos(x2) + 元/2. This implies x2 ≠ 1, because arccos(1) = 0 and arccos(0) = �/2. Therefore, x must be in the interval [-1,1). Thus, the domain of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)) is [-1,1).</td></tr><tr><td>yl,m</td><td>To find the domain of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)), we need to determine the values of x for which the function is defined. Let's break this down step by step. ### Domain of arccos(x2): The function arccos(x2) is defined when -1 ≤ x2 ≤ 1. Since x2 is always non-negative, this simplifies to 0 ≤ x2 ≤ 1. Therefore, -1 ≤ x ≤ 1. ### Domain of tan(0): The function tan(�) is defined for all 0 except where 0 = �/2 + k� for any integer k. ### Combining the domains: We need to find the values of x such that arccos(x2) does not equal �/2 + k�. Since arccos(x2) ranges from 0 to �, the only problematic value is arccos(x2) = �/2. Solving arccos(x2) = �/2, we get x2 = cos(元/2) = 0. Thus, x = 0 is the only value that makes arccos(x2) = �/2. ### Final domain: The function f(x) tan(arccos(x2)) is defined for all x in the in- terval [-1,1] except x = 0. Therefore, the domain of f(x) is [-1,0)U(0,1]. So, the final answer is [-1,0)U(0,1]</td><td>To find the domain of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)), we need to determine the values of x for which the function is defined. Let's break this down step by step. ### Domain of arccos(x2): The function arccos(x2) is defined if -1 ≤ x2 ≤ 1. Since x2 is always non-negative, this simplifies to 0 ≤ x2 ≤ 1. Therefore, x2 must be in the interval [0, 1]. ### Range of arccos(x2): The function arccos(x2) will return values in the interval [0, �]. Specifically, since x2 is in [0, 1], arccos(x2) will return values in [0, �/2]. ### Domain of tan(�): The function tan(�) is defined for all 0 except 0 = �/2+ k� for any integer k. ### Combining the conditions: We need to en- sure that arccos(x2) ≠ �/2. This implies x2 + 1, because arccos(1) = 0 and arccos(0) = �/2. ### Final domain: Therefore, x2 must be in the interval [0, 1) to avoid arccos(x2) = �/2. This means x must be in the interval [-1,1)or(-1,1].</td></tr></table>
