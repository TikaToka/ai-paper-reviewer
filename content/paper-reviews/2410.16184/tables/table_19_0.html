It il- lustrates quantum superposition in quantum mechan- ics, where a cat is both alive and dead until observed, highlighting the paradox of quantum states in macro- scopic objects. The experiment is metaphorical and not real, but emphasizes quantum theory.</td><td>Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment devised by Erwin Schrodinger to highlight quantum entangle- ment in quantum mechanics. It illustrates a paradox where a cat is both alive and dead until observed. This paradox highlights the perplexing nature of quantum theory and entanglement.</td></tr><tr><td>yL,M</td><td>Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment devised by Austrian physicist **Erwin Schr�dinger** in 1935 to illustrate ** quantum superposition**. ### Explanation: The experiment involves a cat in a sealed box, along with a radioactive atom, a Geiger counter, poison, and a hammer. The atom has a 50% chance of decaying, and ifit does, the hammer breaks the vial, killing the cat. According to **quantum mechanics**, the atom exists in a superposition of decayed and not decayed states, and thus, the cat is both **alive and dead** until the box is opened and the cat is observed. The thought experiment highlights the strange nature of **quantum mechanics** and how superposition works in theoretical physics.</td><td>Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment devised by **Erwin Schr�dinger** in 1935 to illustrate **quantum entanglement**. ### The Experiment: A cat is placed in a box with a radioactive atom. If the atom decays, poison is released, killing the cat. According to **quantum theory**, the cat is both alive and dead until the box is opened, representing a paradox in entanglement and quantum theory. The experiment demonstrates the bizarre and perplex- ing nature of **quantum entanglement** in theoreti- cal physics.</td></tr><tr><td>Why Reject</td><td colspan="2">The rejected response is incorrect because Schrodinger's cat illustrates quantum superposition, not quantum entanglement. Quantum superposition refers to the cat being in two states (alive and dead) simultaneously until observed. Quantum entanglement, however, refers to the linking of two particles in such a way that the state of one directly affects the other, which is not the core concept of the Schrodinger's cat experiment.</td></tr></table>
