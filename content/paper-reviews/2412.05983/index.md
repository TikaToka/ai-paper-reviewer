### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large multimodal models (LMMs) excel in general tasks but struggle with specialized domains like chart or table understanding due to their training data bias.  Directly integrating expert models is also challenging because of representation gaps and imbalanced optimization. 



This paper introduces Chimera, a pipeline integrating pre-trained expert models to enhance LMMs for domain-specific tasks.  Chimera uses a progressive training strategy and a novel Generalist-Specialist Collaboration Masking (GSCM) mechanism to address optimization issues.  The results show Chimera achieves state-of-the-art performance on various challenging benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving LMMs' adaptability to domain-specific tasks.

### In-depth insights


#### Multimodal Reasoning
Multimodal reasoning, as a research area, investigates how to enable machines to understand and reason using information from multiple modalities, such as text, images, audio, and video.  **A core challenge lies in effectively integrating and fusing information from these diverse sources**, which often have different representations and structures.  The paper's focus on multimodal reasoning is particularly relevant because it directly addresses this critical challenge by introducing Chimera, a model designed to leverage domain-specific knowledge alongside generalist models. **This highlights a crucial shift in multimodal reasoning research:**  **moving beyond solely general, web-scale training data to incorporate specialized datasets and models**, which improves performance on more challenging, niche tasks. This approach acknowledges that real-world scenarios often require specialized knowledge, and effectively combining these specialized capabilities with generalist models is key to building more robust and capable systems.  The success of Chimera in multi-modal reasoning benchmarks underscores the **importance of hybrid models** that combine domain-specific expertise with the broad capabilities of generalist models, opening new avenues for multimodal reasoning research to focus on the synergistic combination of various models.

#### GSCM Mechanism
The Generalist-Specialist Collaboration Masking (GSCM) mechanism is a crucial innovation in the Chimera framework, designed to address the challenge of integrating domain-specific expert models with a generalist Large Multimodal Model (LMM).  The core problem is **imbalanced optimization**, where the well-aligned general visual encoder might overshadow the contributions of experts. GSCM mitigates this by introducing a masking process during training.  A portion of the general visual tokens are randomly masked, forcing the LMM to rely more heavily on the information provided by the expert models for specific tasks. This masking strategy helps achieve better **feature alignment** and **knowledge integration** between the generalist and specialist components, ultimately improving the overall performance of the multimodal reasoning and visual content extraction tasks.  The effectiveness of GSCM is demonstrated through experimental results showing state-of-the-art performance in various domain-specific benchmarks. The flexible and scalable nature of GSCM makes it adaptable to various LMMs and expert model combinations, highlighting its potential for broader applications in multimodal learning.

#### Progressive Training
Progressive training, in the context of large multimodal models (LMMs), is a crucial technique for effectively integrating domain-specific expert models into a generalist model.  It involves a phased approach where features from expert models are gradually incorporated into the training process. **This phased integration helps mitigate the inherent challenges posed by representation gaps and imbalanced optimization between the generalist and specialist models.**  A key benefit is that it allows for a more stable and efficient learning process, preventing catastrophic forgetting or disruptive interference. **The strategy can incorporate various masking mechanisms to strategically balance the learning contributions of general and specific features.** The ultimate objective is to enhance the generalist LMM's performance on domain-specific tasks without significantly compromising its generalization ability across broader domains. This progressive strategy proves particularly effective in multi-modal reasoning and visual content extraction tasks, where specialized domain knowledge is crucial for state-of-the-art performance.

#### Scalability & Low-cost
The concept of 'Scalability & Low-cost' in the context of large multimodal models (LMMs) is crucial.  **Scalability** refers to the ability of a model to handle increasingly large datasets and complex tasks without significant performance degradation.  This is often achieved through architectural innovations like efficient transformers or by leveraging distributed computing resources.  **Low-cost** relates to the computational and financial resources needed for training and deploying the model.  This is particularly important for broader adoption and accessibility.  A system demonstrating both scalability and low cost would ideally allow for efficient training on massive datasets, yet remain deployable on hardware with limited resources. This balance is vital for both research and real-world applications, enabling the development of more powerful LMMs without prohibitive costs or excessive computational demands.  **Progressive training strategies**, where smaller, specialized models are integrated into a larger generalist model, represent a promising approach to achieve this balance, offering significant improvements in performance while keeping costs down.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this work on improving generalist models with domain-specific experts could focus on several key areas. **More sophisticated fusion methods** beyond the proposed Generalist-Specialist Collaboration Masking (GSCM) should be explored to better handle representation gaps and imbalanced optimization between generalist and specialist models.  **Investigating the impact of different expert model architectures** and training strategies would be valuable.  Exploring alternative routing mechanisms to select experts could enhance efficiency and accuracy. **Further analysis is needed to understand how scaling up the number of experts affects performance and computational cost.** A broader evaluation across a wider range of domain-specific tasks, beyond chart, table, math, and document understanding, will help establish the robustness and generalizability of the approach.  Finally, exploring the potential for applying this framework to other modalities, beyond image and text, could significantly expand its utility and applicability. **Investigating theoretical bounds of the model's performance and developing efficient inference methods are essential steps for practical deployment.**

Three metrics are used for comparison: TEDS (Tree-Edit Distance-based Similarity), TEDS (structure only), and Edit Distance.  The TEDS metric measures the similarity between two tree structures, representing the table structures generated by each model and the ground truth. The 'TEDS (structure only)' metric focuses solely on the structural aspects of the tables, ignoring the content.  The Edit Distance metric provides a simpler comparison of the textual representation of tables.  By comparing these metrics across different methods, the table provides a detailed evaluation of the models' ability to accurately extract and reconstruct the structure and content of tables.
