For example, one may falsify bank statements to make it seem like the business\u2019s sales have been good and that the business isn\u2019t running a deficit, so that they can secure loans to grow the business.

That said, if I were the one to write the standard guide, I would recommend tabs since they are a modern and more practical way to indent code. Finally, I\u2019ll stress, I am not encouraging anybody to use tabs, instead, I am saying that all of us should use spaces as stated in the style guide. | You can have your cake and eat it to.
