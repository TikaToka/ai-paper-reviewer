By measuring the cosine similarity between this new subspace and previously learned prompt subspaces, the framework determines whether a similar prompt already exists. If a match is found, the existing prompt is reused for initialization, enhancing knowledge retention. Otherwise, a new prompt is initialized in an orthogonal subspace to the existing prompts, ensuring differentiation and efficient adaptation. (b) The prompt embeddings consist of two key components: tunable soft tokens and a PCA-based transformation matrix. This design significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters compared to traditional prompt tuning methods, making the approach more efficient while preserving model adaptability.", "description": "\uadf8\ub9bc 1\uc740 SPARC\uc758 \uac1c\uc694\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.
