### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) often contain many weakly-contributing elements in their activation outputs.  Reducing these improves efficiency and interpretability. However, existing research lacks a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing activation sparsity. This paper investigates this gap by focusing on decoder-only Transformer-based LLMs.



The researchers propose a new metric, PPL-p% sparsity, to precisely measure activation sparsity while considering model performance.  Through extensive experiments, they uncover several scaling laws describing the relationship between activation sparsity and training data, activation functions, and architectural design. These findings provide valuable insights into designing LLMs with significantly greater activation sparsity, ultimately paving the way towards more efficient and interpretable AI.

> üîº Figure 1 illustrates activation sparsity in a large language model (LLM).  The gated feed-forward network within the LLM processes input, and the activation function produces an output. In this example, a significant portion (60%) of the activation function's output consists of elements with weak contributions to the final output. These weakly-contributing elements represent the activation sparsity, and they can be eliminated for potential computational gains or model interpretation improvements.

### In-depth insights


#### Sparsity Scaling Laws
The research explores sparsity scaling laws in large language models (LLMs), revealing crucial insights into the relationship between activation sparsity and key factors like training data and model architecture.  **ReLU activation functions demonstrate superior efficiency in enhancing sparsity compared to SiLU**, exhibiting a convergent decreasing relationship with training data. Conversely, SiLU shows a convergent increasing trend.  **Activation sparsity increases linearly with the width-depth ratio, up to a certain point**, highlighting the potential benefits of deeper architectures.  Interestingly,  **the limit of activation sparsity shows weak correlation with the parameter scale**, indicating that activation patterns remain consistent across various model sizes, although smaller models achieve convergence faster.  These findings offer valuable guidance for designing more efficient and interpretable LLMs by leveraging the potential of greater activation sparsity.

#### PPL-p% Sparsity Metric
The research introduces a novel metric, **PPL-p% sparsity**, to more effectively measure activation sparsity in large language models (LLMs). Unlike previous methods that rely on arbitrary thresholds, this metric directly incorporates model performance (perplexity or PPL), making it performance-aware.  It identifies weakly-contributed neurons by adaptively determining layer-wise thresholds, ensuring that the increased perplexity resulting from their inactivation stays within a specified range (p%). This approach offers several advantages: **versatility across various model architectures and activation functions**, **performance-awareness**, and **precise recognition of weakly-contributed neurons**, ultimately providing a more reliable and insightful measure of activation sparsity for LLMs.

#### Activation Function Effects
The research reveals a **surprising contrast** in the behavior of ReLU and SiLU activation functions regarding activation sparsity. While both achieve comparable performance, they exhibit **opposite training-time sparsity trends.**  ReLU-activated LLMs demonstrate a **convergent decreasing logspace power-law**, becoming increasingly sparse with more training data. Conversely, SiLU-activated models show a **convergent increasing power-law**, indicating reduced sparsity with increased training. This suggests ReLU is **more efficient** at leveraging training data for improved activation sparsity.  The study also shows that **ReLU consistently outperforms SiLU** in terms of achieving higher sparsity at comparable performance levels.

#### Width-Depth Ratio Impact
The research explores how the width-depth ratio in Transformer-based LLMs significantly impacts activation sparsity.  **A linear increase in activation ratio is observed with increasing width-depth ratio, up to a specific bottleneck point.** Beyond this point, the activation ratio stabilizes, suggesting diminishing returns.  This indicates that **deeper architectures may be advantageous for achieving higher sparsity at a fixed parameter scale**, but there's an optimal width-depth ratio to consider to avoid performance degradation. The study also reveals a surprising finding that the limit value of activation sparsity at high training data levels is only weakly dependent on the parameter scale.

#### Future Research
The paper does not contain a heading explicitly titled 'Future Research'.  Therefore, a summary cannot be provided.  However, the conclusion section hints at promising avenues for future work.  **Investigating the correlation between activation sparsity and neuron specialization** is highlighted as a crucial area needing further exploration.  This would provide valuable insights into the dynamics of model training and potentially lead to better methods for controlling and promoting activation sparsity.  Additionally, **extending the research to even larger LLMs** with more parameters and evaluating the effects on sparsity patterns is suggested.  Finally, a more in-depth analysis of **the impact of dataset distribution on sparsity** is recommended.  This would help to refine the scaling laws and make them more widely applicable and robust across varied datasets.

> üîº This figure illustrates the Pareto curves that show the trade-off between activation sparsity and model perplexity (PPL) for different models.  The 0.1B parameter MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) model is shown with varying numbers of experts (16, 30, and 60), while the vanilla 0.1B parameter decoder-only Transformer serves as a baseline for comparison.  The x-axis represents the activation ratio (1-sparsity ratio), indicating the proportion of activated neurons. The y-axis represents the perplexity, a measure of the model's prediction accuracy.  Lower perplexity indicates better performance, while a higher activation ratio implies lower sparsity. The curves reveal the performance-sparsity trade-off, demonstrating that increasing activation sparsity often comes at the cost of higher perplexity (reduced performance). The comparison highlights the performance-sparsity trade-off differences between MoE and vanilla models.

> üîº This table presents the performance of various LLMs on commonsense reasoning benchmarks.  Different model sizes (0.1B, 0.2B, 0.4B, 0.8B, 1.2B parameters) and activation functions (ReLU and SiLU) are evaluated.  For each model configuration, the 'dense' setting represents the full model performance, while PPL-1%, PPL-5%, and PPL-10% represent performance at different levels of activation sparsity. The results are shown as accuracy scores (%) for five specific commonsense reasoning datasets (PIQA, SIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, and COPA), with a final average score across these datasets also included.  This allows comparison of model accuracy across different sparsity levels and configurations.
