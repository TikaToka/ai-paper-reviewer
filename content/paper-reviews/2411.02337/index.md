### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current LLM web agents heavily rely on costly proprietary APIs, while open LLMs lack decision-making capabilities. This paper introduces WEBRL, a novel framework addressing this issue by training high-performing web agents using open LLMs.  WEBRL tackles challenges like limited training tasks and sparse feedback through a self-evolving curriculum that generates new tasks from failed attempts, a robust reward model, and adaptive learning strategies. 

WEBRL successfully transforms open Llama-3.1 and GLM-4 models into proficient web agents.  Its performance surpasses proprietary LLMs like GPT-4-Turbo and achieves state-of-the-art results on the WebArena-Lite benchmark. This work demonstrates WEBRL's effectiveness in bridging the gap between open and proprietary LLM-based web agents, making autonomous web interactions more accessible and powerful.

### In-depth insights


#### Online Curriculum RL
The research paper section on "Online Curriculum RL" introduces **WEBRL**, a novel framework for training large language model (LLM) web agents.  It directly tackles the challenges of **limited training data**, **sparse feedback**, and **policy drift** inherent in online reinforcement learning. WEBRL innovatively uses a **self-evolving curriculum** that generates new tasks from past failures, improving data efficiency.  A **robust outcome-supervised reward model (ORM)** addresses sparse feedback by automatically evaluating task success.  Finally, **adaptive reinforcement learning strategies**, including a KL-divergence constraint on policy updates and an actor confidence-filtered experience replay buffer, ensure stable and continuous improvement, preventing catastrophic forgetting. This approach significantly enhances the performance of open-source LLMs as web agents, bridging the gap with proprietary models.

#### WebAgent Training
The research paper section on 'WebAgent Training' details a novel framework, WEBRL, designed to overcome challenges in training effective web agents using open LLMs.  **WEBRL employs self-evolving online curriculum reinforcement learning**, addressing limitations like scarce training data and sparse feedback.  A key innovation is its **self-evolving curriculum**, which generates new tasks from past failures, dynamically adjusting difficulty.  The framework also incorporates a **robust outcome-supervised reward model (ORM)** to accurately assess task success.  To ensure continual improvement, **adaptive reinforcement learning strategies** and a KL-divergence constraint prevent policy distribution drift.  Experimental results demonstrate WEBRL's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, significantly bridging the gap between open and proprietary LLM-based web agents.

#### LLM-based Agents
The research paper section on "LLM-based Agents" explores the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs) in autonomous agent applications, specifically focusing on web-based tasks.  It highlights the significant potential of LLMs as agents but notes the **heavy reliance of current systems on expensive proprietary APIs**, limiting accessibility.  A key challenge identified is the **lack of decision-making capabilities in open-source LLMs**, hindering their effectiveness in complex web interactions. The authors emphasize the need for innovative solutions to overcome the **scarcity of training tasks, sparse feedback signals, and policy distribution drift**, inherent in online LLM agent training.  This section sets the stage for introducing the proposed framework as a solution to these challenges, paving the way for creating more powerful and accessible autonomous web agents based on open-source LLMs.

> üîº WebRL is a novel framework for training large language model (LLM) web agents using online reinforcement learning.  It addresses three key challenges: the scarcity of training tasks, sparse feedback, and policy distribution drift.  The figure illustrates WebRL's self-evolving curriculum, where new tasks are dynamically generated from past failures.  This curriculum adapts to the agent's current skill level and uses a robust outcome-supervised reward model.  Adaptive reinforcement learning strategies, including a KL-divergence constrained policy update, and an experience replay buffer with actor confidence filtering further enhance continuous improvements.  The diagram shows the flow of information and interactions between components like the agent, the environment, a reward model, and a replay buffer, highlighting the iterative nature of the self-evolving curriculum and the continuous learning process.

> üîº This table details the hyperparameter settings used for training the WebRL model and several baseline models.  It lists the specific hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, scheduler type, batch size, etc.) and their corresponding values for each of the training methods: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Filtered Behavior Cloning (Filtered BC), Advantage Weighted Regression (AWR), DigiRL, and WebRL. This information allows for comparison of the training procedures used to generate the results and analysis of their impact on model performance.

> üîº This table details the hyperparameters used during the training of the Outcome-Supervised Reward Model (ORM).  The ORM is a crucial component of the WEBRL framework, responsible for evaluating the success or failure of an agent's actions in completing web-based tasks.  The hyperparameters shown influence various aspects of the training process, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, and the number of training epochs.
