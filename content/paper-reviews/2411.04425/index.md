### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing their performance but often involves redundant data, increasing computational costs.  Existing methods usually focus on a single optimization stage and can be computationally expensive. This poses a significant challenge for efficient and effective LLM adaptation.  Researchers need an efficient method to select optimal subsets that are useful across all stages of fine-tuning. 

DELIFT addresses these issues by systematically optimizing data selection across all three key stages of fine-tuning using a novel pairwise utility metric.  This metric quantifies how beneficial a data sample is for improving the model's performance on other samples.  **Leveraging submodular functions, DELIFT efficiently selects diverse and optimal data subsets across different fine-tuning stages.**  Experimental results show that DELIFT reduces fine-tuning data size by up to 70% without compromising performance, providing significant computational savings and outperforming existing methods.

> üîº This table presents the results of the DELIFT model on the MixInstruct dataset for Use Case 1 (Instruction Tuning).  It compares the performance of DELIFT against several baselines: Initial (the model's performance before fine-tuning), Random (randomly selecting a subset of data), SelectIT, LESS, DELIFT (SE) (DELIFT using sentence embeddings instead of the utility-based kernel), and Full Data (using the entire dataset). Performance is measured using three metrics: ICL, QLORA, and ROUGE, along with their sub-metrics (BGE and LAJ).  The bold values indicate the best-performing method for each metric.  Key findings highlighted in the caption are that DELIFT, after pruning 70% of the data, shows only a 10.44% drop in performance from the full dataset and only a 2.27% drop in performance compared to the next-best performing baseline.
