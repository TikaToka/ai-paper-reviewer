[{"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2502.08826/extracted/6211743/MM-RAG-500.png", "caption": "Figure 1: \nOverview of the multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, highlighting the advancements and techniques employed at each stage. The flow begins with query preprocessing, where user queries are refined and then encoded into a shared embedding space alongside a multimodal database. Retrieval strategies, such as modality-centric retrieval, similarity search, and re-ranking, enhance document selection, while fusion mechanisms align and integrate data from multiple modalities using score fusion or attention-based methods. Augmentation techniques such as iterative retrieval with feedback mechanisms, further refine the retrieved documents for the multimodal LLM. The generation stage incorporates innovations like Chain-of-Thought reasoning and source attribution for better outputs, with loss functions combining alignment loss and generation loss to optimize both retrieval and generation components. Noise management techniques are also applied to improve training stability and robustness.", "description": "\uadf8\ub9bc 1\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0(\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0, \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ub4f1)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uac80\uc0c9 \uc99d\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131(RAG) \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc758 \uac1c\uc694\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \uba3c\uc800 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc9c8\uc758\uac00 \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac\ub418\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uacf5\uc720 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uc911\uc2ec \uac80\uc0c9, \uc720\uc0ac\ub3c4 \uac80\uc0c9, \uc7ac\uc21c\uc704 \uc9c0\uc815\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad00\ub828 \ubb38\uc11c\uac00 \uc120\ud0dd\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \uc735\ud569 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uc2a4\ucf54\uc5b4 \uc735\ud569 \ub610\ub294 \uc5b4\ud150\uc158 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc815\ub82c\ud558\uace0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uac80\uc0c9\uacfc \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc99d\uac15 \uae30\ubc95\uc740 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec LLM\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac80\uc0c9\ub41c \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \ub354\uc6b1 \uc138\ub828\ub418\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uace0 \uc5f0\uc1c4 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc18c\uc2a4 \uc18d\uc131 \uc9c0\uc815\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud601\uc2e0\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uacb0\uacfc\ubb3c\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc815\ub82c \uc190\uc2e4\uacfc \uc0dd\uc131 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc131 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uad00\ub9ac \uae30\ubc95\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "section": "1 Introduction & Background"}]
