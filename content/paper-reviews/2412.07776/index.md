### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current text-to-video synthesis methods struggle to precisely control the motion of generated videos, relying heavily on textual descriptions which are often ambiguous.  Existing motion transfer methods often utilize UNet architectures and are computationally expensive.  There's a need for a more efficient and effective motion transfer technique tailored for the latest Diffusion Transformer models, which offer improved scalability and realism.

DiTFlow addresses these limitations by leveraging the attention mechanism of Diffusion Transformers to extract motion patterns directly from the video.  It employs a training-free, optimization-based approach using Attention Motion Flow (AMF) to guide the video generation process, resulting in realistic motion transfer.  DiTFlow outperforms existing methods across various metrics and even enables zero-shot motion transfer via positional embedding optimization, significantly reducing computational costs.

### In-depth insights


#### DiTFlow: Motion Transfer
DiTFlow presents a novel approach to video motion transfer, specifically designed for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs).  Instead of relying on traditional UNet architectures, **DiTFlow leverages the inherent global attention mechanism of DiTs to extract motion patterns directly from the network's internal representations**. This is achieved through the creation of Attention Motion Flow (AMF), a patch-wise motion signal derived from analyzing cross-frame attention maps.  The AMF guides the latent denoising process in a training-free, optimization-based manner, enabling realistic motion transfer to newly synthesized video content.  A key innovation is the ability to optimize DiT positional embeddings, facilitating zero-shot motion transfer without requiring further optimization for each new video generation.  This makes DiTFlow computationally efficient, especially when handling multiple videos.  **DiTFlow's training-free nature and its exploitation of DiT's unique architecture offer a significant advancement in motion transfer, outperforming existing UNet-based methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.**

#### AMF: Attention Flow
The concept of "AMF: Attention Motion Flow" represents a novel approach to video motion transfer, leveraging the inherent capabilities of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs).  Instead of relying on traditional methods, which often struggle with disentangling motion from content, **AMF directly extracts motion patterns from the DiT's cross-frame attention maps**. This is a significant departure, as it exploits the global attention mechanism within DiTs to capture intricate relationships between video frames.  **The training-free nature of AMF is a key strength**, making it computationally efficient and adaptable to various DiT architectures. By employing optimization techniques, the AMF guides the latent denoising process, effectively transferring the motion of a reference video to newly synthesized content.  **The innovative application of AMF to optimize positional embeddings opens the door to zero-shot motion transfer**, a significant advancement over previous methods.  This represents a potent combination of efficient motion extraction and powerful control over the video generation process, demonstrating a promising direction in realistic and controllable video synthesis.

#### Zero-shot Transfer
The concept of 'zero-shot transfer' in the context of video motion transfer is **highly innovative**. It signifies the ability of a model, after training on a dataset of videos and prompts, to transfer motion from a reference video to a newly generated video conditioned on a completely unseen prompt.  This is a significant advance over traditional approaches requiring additional training or fine-tuning for each new motion-transfer task. The success hinges on **learning generalizable motion representations** that can be applied across diverse scenarios.  **Optimizing positional embeddings** within the diffusion transformer model is crucial to achieving this. By altering these embeddings, the model can reorganize its latent representation of the video, effectively transferring motion without retraining, and hence, in a true zero-shot manner. This method demonstrates the **power of disentanglement**, separating content from motion and thus allowing for flexible and efficient video manipulation.

#### DiT Optimization
Optimizing Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for video motion transfer presents a unique challenge.  The paper explores two key optimization strategies: **latent optimization** and **positional embedding optimization**. Latent optimization directly adjusts the latent representations of the video at various denoising steps, minimizing the discrepancy between the generated video's motion and that of a reference video. This approach yields high-quality results, but is computationally expensive.  Conversely, positional embedding optimization modifies the positional embeddings within the DiT, enabling zero-shot motion transfer. This method significantly reduces computational cost, but may result in slightly less precise motion control.  The choice between these strategies depends on the desired balance between accuracy and efficiency. **The AMF loss function** plays a crucial role, guiding both optimization strategies by quantifying the difference between the generated and reference Attention Motion Flows.  The effectiveness of each method is thoroughly evaluated and compared, offering valuable insights into the tradeoffs involved in optimizing DiTs for video motion transfer.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore **improving the robustness of DiTFlow to handle more diverse and complex motions** beyond those seen in the training data.  This might involve investigating more sophisticated motion representations or incorporating additional cues to guide the generation process.  Another key area is **reducing the computational cost**, particularly for high-resolution videos or longer sequences.  Exploring efficient optimization strategies or leveraging architectural innovations in diffusion models are promising avenues.  Finally, **enhancing the level of control** over the generated videos is crucial. This could involve developing methods to seamlessly blend different motion styles, control the intensity of motion transfer, or allow more precise manipulation of specific elements within the video.  Investigating the use of different prompt modalities beyond text, such as sketches or other visual cues, could broaden the applications and improve the ease of use.

> üîº DiTFlow uses a reference video to guide the generation of new videos.  First, it extracts a patch-wise motion signal (Attention Motion Flow or AMF) from the reference video using a pre-trained Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This AMF is then used to condition the latent representation (z<sub>t</sub>) during the video generation process, ensuring the synthesized video mimics the motion of the reference video.  The figure highlights the key steps: extracting the AMF from the reference video, using the DiT to generate a new video latent representation, and guiding that latent representation with the AMF to match the reference motion.  Additionally, the experiments explored optimizing positional embeddings within the DiT to enable zero-shot motion transfer, where motion is transferred to new videos without additional optimization.

> üîº Figure 3 illustrates the process of generating Attention Motion Flow (AMF) from a reference video.  It begins by processing cross-frame attention maps obtained from a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model. The argmax operation identifies the strongest attention relationships between patches in consecutive frames, creating a displacement map that shows how patches move over time.  For generating new videos, a soft argmax is used instead of argmax to retain gradient information during optimization, ensuring smoother motion transfer.  The reference displacement is then used as guidance to constrain the motion of the synthesized video.

We compute the reference displacement by processing cross-frame attentions with an argmax operation and rearranging them into displacement maps, identifying patch-aware cross-frame relationships. For video synthesis, we do the same operation with a soft argmax to preserve gradients, and impose reconstruction with the reference displacement.

> üîº Figure 4 demonstrates a comparison of motion transfer results between DiTFlow and several baseline methods.  The baselines, relying on UNet architectures, struggle with accurate motion transfer because their spatial averaging or localized deviation analysis fails to capture the complete spatiotemporal context of motion. This leads to errors in associating motion to the correct elements within the video frame.  In contrast, DiTFlow leverages the attention mechanism within Diffusion Transformers to comprehensively understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of each patch within the video.  This results in more precise motion transfer and accurate spatial positioning and sizing of moving elements within the generated video. The figure provides three examples illustrating this difference: a dog running, a bear running, and a parachutist descending.  In each example, DiTFlow achieves significantly better motion transfer accuracy than the baselines.

The bar chart visually represents the distribution of responses for each model across the levels of agreement (strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree).

> üîº This table presents ablation study results on the impact of varying the number of denoising steps on the performance of the DiTFlow model.  Specifically, it shows how changing the percentage of denoising steps guided by the AMF (Attention Motion Flow) affects the model's Motion Fidelity (MF) and Image Quality (IQ) scores.  The results are presented for different percentages of guided steps (0%, 20%, 40%, 80%, and 100%), allowing for an analysis of the optimal balance between guidance and computational cost.

> üîº This table presents ablation study results for the DiTFlow model, investigating different aspects of its inference pipeline.  The first part (2a) analyzes the contribution of different DiT blocks to motion transfer, showing that earlier blocks are more influential. The second and third parts (2b and 2c) examine the impact of increasing computational resources by varying the number of denoising steps and optimization steps, respectively, demonstrating performance improvements with greater computational power.

> üîº This table presents a subset of the DAVIS dataset used in the paper's experiments.  For each video, three different prompts are provided, categorized as 'Caption,' 'Subject,' and 'Scene.'  The 'Caption' prompt is a simple description of the video content.  The 'Subject' prompt alters the subject of the video while maintaining a similar scene.  The 'Scene' prompt completely changes the scene and context while keeping the original video's motion as inspiration.  This sampling showcases the variety of videos and prompt types employed in the evaluation to thoroughly assess the motion transfer techniques.
