### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Diffusion models generate high-quality images but are computationally expensive due to their multi-step generation process.  Prior methods like Rectified Flow attempted to speed this up by straightening ODE flow trajectories, but limitations remained, particularly in accurately learning straight trajectories and achieving optimal few-step generation. These limitations stemmed from approximating couplings (image and noise pairs) with constant velocity, which often resulted in suboptimal performance and curved sampling trajectories. 

To address this, the authors introduce Constant Acceleration Flow (CAF), which models couplings using a simple constant acceleration equation instead of constant velocity.  CAF introduces acceleration as an additional learnable variable, enabling more accurate and expressive ODE flow estimation.  Moreover, to further improve accuracy, they propose two techniques: initial velocity conditioning for the acceleration model and a reflow process for the initial velocity.  Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that CAF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, exhibiting superior performance in both one-step and few-step generation while preserving coupling and inversion more effectively.

> üîº This figure compares the sampling trajectories of Rectified Flow and Constant Acceleration Flow (CAF). Rectified Flow, shown in (a), uses a constant velocity model for estimating the ODE flow.  Due to limitations of this model in accurately capturing the relationship between image-noise pairs, it produces curved trajectories and flow crossing, as seen at the intersection point (x = x^2).  In contrast, CAF, shown in (b), incorporates a constant acceleration term as an additional learnable variable, resulting in improved flow estimation accuracy and straighter trajectories that accurately reflect the ground truth trajectory, minimizing flow crossing and improving the precision of ODE flow estimation.

### In-depth insights


#### Accel Flow Intro
The Accel Flow Intro section introduces Constant Acceleration Flow (CAF), a novel framework that addresses limitations of existing rectified flow models in accurately learning straight trajectories for image generation.  **CAF incorporates acceleration as a learnable variable**, moving beyond the constant velocity assumption of previous methods. This enhancement allows for more expressive and accurate estimation of the ODE flow, significantly improving performance.  The introduction also highlights the issue of flow crossing, where sampling trajectories intersect, leading to suboptimal results, and previews CAF's innovative solutions to this problem, including **initial velocity conditioning (IVC) and a reflow process** to improve accuracy and avoid curved trajectories. The section concludes by emphasizing CAF's superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods for one-step and few-step image generation.

#### IVC & Reflow
To overcome the limitations of constant velocity modeling in rectified flow, which struggles with accurately learning straight trajectories due to flow crossing, the authors introduce **initial velocity conditioning (IVC)** and **reflow** procedures within their Constant Acceleration Flow (CAF) framework.  IVC conditions the acceleration model on the estimated initial velocity, thereby reducing ambiguity and improving trajectory estimation, especially near intersection points. The reflow process further enhances accuracy by refining the initial velocity learning using a pre-trained generative model to create more deterministic data couplings. These two strategies work synergistically to address flow crossing, resulting in more accurate and efficient learning of straight ODE trajectories, as demonstrated in the superior performance of CAF over baseline methods in one-step and few-step generation tasks.

#### Synthetic & Real Data
The paper evaluates Constant Acceleration Flow (CAF) using synthetic and real-world datasets.  **Synthetic experiments** on a 2D dataset demonstrate CAF's superior accuracy in approximating target distributions compared to Rectified Flow, especially when using negative acceleration.  **Real-world experiments** on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 64x64 show CAF achieving state-of-the-art FID scores, highlighting its ability to generate high-quality images even with one-step generation.  In both cases, the introduction of acceleration as a learnable parameter and the initial velocity conditioning proved crucial for improved performance, substantially reducing the impact of flow crossings. The ablation study further confirms these findings, emphasizing the importance of each component of the CAF framework.

#### Coupling Analysis
The Coupling Analysis section delves into the accuracy of approximating deterministic couplings in both CAF and Rectified Flow.  **Synthetic experiments reveal CAF's superior ability to preserve ground-truth couplings, particularly when flow crossing occurs.**  This is demonstrated through visual comparisons of sampling trajectories, showing that CAF maintains straight trajectories while Rectified Flow produces curved ones. Real-world CIFAR-10 experiments using LPIPS and PSNR metrics further solidify CAF's advantage. **CAF exhibits significantly lower LPIPS scores and higher PSNR values, signifying better preservation of the original data relationships.**  The superior performance of CAF in preserving couplings underscores its enhanced expressiveness in modeling complex relationships between data points, leading to more accurate and reliable generative results.  **This improved coupling preservation is crucial for achieving high-quality image generation, especially when dealing with few sampling steps.**

#### Limitations & Future
The authors acknowledge that their Constant Acceleration Flow (CAF) model, while improving speed and quality in image generation, has limitations.  **Increased computational cost** compared to Rectified Flow is a primary concern due to the additional calculation of acceleration at each step.  **Improving efficiency** through techniques like jointly predicting velocity and acceleration is suggested for future work.  Additionally, the need for **supplementary data generation** for optimal model training adds to resource consumption. Future research should focus on addressing these limitations to make CAF more efficient and resource-friendly, potentially exploring alternative training strategies or model architectures that minimize computational overhead while retaining performance advantages.
