highlighted tokens indicating uncertainty levels.\nThe outputs have been color-coded to reflect the confidence levels of the model\u2019s token predictions. Tokens are highlighted in purple when the highest probability is below 0.8 (indicating lower certainty without significant contention), in blue when the second-highest probability exceeds 0.1 (indicating contention, where another token is a close alternative), and in red when both conditions are met (indicating high uncertainty). These examples illustrate varying levels of prediction confidence and contention in reasoning steps, emphasizing regions of high ambiguity or competition between plausible continuations. This type of visual analysis is useful for identifying points in the reasoning process where the model lacks confidence or is torn between alternatives, guiding refinements in reasoning strategies and model design. It also helps pinpoint critical areas where additional supervision or context may improve model performance.", "description": "\uadf8\ub9bc 7\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c9\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ubd84\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd9c\ub825\uc758 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc608\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \ud655\ub960\uc774 0.8 \ubbf8\ub9cc\uc774\uba74 \ubcf4\ub77c\uc0c9\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\uc870 \ud45c\uc2dc\ub418\uc5b4 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uacbd\uc7c1 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub0ae\uc740 \ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uace0, \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8\ub85c \ub192\uc740 \ud655\ub960\uc774 0.1\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba74 \ud30c\ub780\uc0c9\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\uc870 \ud45c\uc2dc\ub418\uc5b4 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud1a0\ud070\uc774 \uadfc\uc811\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc774 \ub418\ub294 \uacbd\uc7c1 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc870\uac74\uc774 \ubaa8\ub450 \ucda9\uc871\ub418\uba74 \ube68\uac04\uc0c9\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\uc870 \ud45c\uc2dc\ub418\uc5b4 \ub192\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc608\uc2dc\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uce21 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\uc640 \uacbd\uc7c1 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ud0c0\ub2f9\ud55c \uc5f0\uc18d\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uc774\ub098 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc9c0\uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud655\uc2e0\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub300\uc548 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c \uac08\ub4f1\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc9c0\uc810\uc744 \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uace0, \ucd94\ub860 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uac10\ub3c5\uc774\ub098 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc911\uc694 \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \ud30c\uc545\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "section": "7.6 Example Analyses: Token Probability Distributions"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.11223/x33.png", "caption": "(a) To evaluate \u230820\u23092superscript202\\lceil{\\sqrt{20}}\\rceil^{2}\u2308 square-root start_ARG 20 end_ARG \u2309 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):1.
