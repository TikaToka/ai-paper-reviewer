### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current low-bit quantization techniques primarily focus on optimizing resource efficiency in large language models (LLMs) without considering the impact of model training stage. This research reveals that low-bit quantization performs exceptionally well on undertrained LLMs but shows significant degradation on fully-trained models. This study identified this issue, explored the scaling laws that govern this phenomena, and predicted the effect on future LLMs. 

This paper addresses this gap by conducting experiments on over 1500 quantized LLMs checkpoints, deriving scaling laws to predict quantization-induced degradation (QiD) based on training tokens, model size, and bit-width. These laws reveal that QiD increases with the number of training tokens and decreases with model size and bit-width, indicating a preference for undertrained LLMs. The researchers also predict that the trend will continue with future LLMs, highlighting a potential limitation of low-bit quantization techniques.

### In-depth insights


#### Quantization Limits
The concept of "Quantization Limits" in the context of large language models (LLMs) centers on the inherent trade-offs between model compression and performance degradation.  **Lower-bit quantization**, while effective in reducing model size and improving inference speed, inevitably introduces **information loss**.  This loss manifests as quantization-induced degradation (QiD), impacting the model's accuracy and overall effectiveness.  The paper investigates how different factors, such as model size, training data, and quantization bit-width, influence QiD.  A key finding is that **undertrained models are more resilient to quantization**, exhibiting less degradation compared to their fully-trained counterparts.  This suggests **a fundamental limit to the effectiveness of aggressive quantization on highly-trained, large LLMs**, hinting at the need for alternative compression techniques or a re-evaluation of training strategies for future, massive LLMs.

#### Training Level Impact
The research reveals a crucial, previously overlooked aspect of low-bit quantization: its strong dependence on the model's training level.  **Undertrained LLMs exhibit significantly less quantization-induced degradation (QiD) compared to their fully trained counterparts.** This is because undertrained models have weights that fluctuate significantly during training; hence, small weight changes caused by quantization have a minimal impact. Conversely, fully trained models show minimal weight variation, making them highly susceptible to QiD as low-bit quantization pushes weights beyond their established narrow range. This finding introduces a **new perspective on evaluating low-bit quantization techniques**, highlighting the necessity of considering the training level when assessing their effectiveness.  The study's scaling laws provide a tool to predict the performance of future models, suggesting potential challenges for low-bit quantization as models scale to 100 trillion training tokens.

#### Scaling Laws QiD
The concept of "Scaling Laws for Quantization-Induced Degradation (QiD)" explores how the amount of performance loss from quantization changes with key model attributes.  The research likely investigates **scaling relationships** between QiD and factors like model size, number of training tokens, and bit-width.  A key finding might show that **smaller models or those extensively trained suffer more from quantization**, while larger, less-trained models are more robust. This suggests a crucial tradeoff:  while larger models offer better performance, their sensitivity to quantization could hinder efficient deployment.  The study could further propose a **unified scaling law** that combines these factors, enabling predictions of QiD for future, larger models.  Ultimately, these findings highlight the importance of considering training levels when evaluating quantization techniques and offer valuable insights for future model design and deployment strategies.

#### Unified Scaling Law
The concept of a Unified Scaling Law in the context of low-bit quantization for LLMs attempts to **create a single, comprehensive mathematical model** that captures how quantization-induced degradation (QiD) changes based on three key factors: model size, number of training tokens, and bit-width.  It builds upon existing scaling laws for LLM performance, extending them to account for the effects of quantization.  This unified approach is **crucial for predicting the performance** of future, extremely large language models (LLMs) under low-bit quantization, helping researchers anticipate potential challenges and guide the design of more efficient quantization techniques.  The successful development and validation of a Unified Scaling Law would represent a significant advancement in the field, **providing a powerful predictive tool** for evaluating and optimizing the trade-offs between model size, training data, precision, and quantization performance.  **Its accuracy depends heavily** on the range and quality of the datasets used for training and validation, as well as the generalizability of the underlying model across different architectures and quantization methods.  Further work should focus on testing its limits and refining it to be more robust and widely applicable.

#### Future of Quant
The research paper explores the challenges and opportunities in low-bit quantization for large language models (LLMs).  **A key finding is that low-bit quantization performs well on undertrained LLMs but struggles with fully trained models.** This implies that as LLMs continue to grow in size and training data, the effectiveness of this widely used efficiency technique might diminish. **The paper suggests a need for a paradigm shift**, perhaps towards methods that are less sensitive to the model's training level, or designing LLMs inherently suited for low-bit precision.  **Future research should consider the interplay of model size, training data, and quantization bit width**, to better predict performance and develop more robust quantization strategies.  Furthermore, exploring alternative quantization methods beyond GPTQ, or focusing on techniques suited to specific model architectures, could yield valuable improvements. Ultimately, the future of quantization for LLMs hinges on addressing this critical limitation and moving beyond simplistic scaling laws to develop more sophisticated and effective solutions.

> üîº This figure displays boxplots visualizing the change in model weights between consecutive checkpoints during training for both undertrained and fully trained LLMs.  The boxplots show that undertrained models exhibit significant weight fluctuations throughout training, meaning the model is tolerant of variations in weight values.  Consequently, the small weight changes introduced by low-bit quantization have minimal impact on performance. In contrast, fully-trained models display very little weight fluctuation during the later stages of training.  Low-bit quantization is more likely to shift weights outside this narrow range of recent variations, causing potential performance degradation or even model failure.  The figure provides visual evidence supporting the paper's claim that low-bit quantization is more effective for undertrained LLMs.

Therefore, small changes introduced by quantization have a limited impact on the model‚Äôs performance.

As a result, low-bit quantization is likely to push weights beyond the narrow range of recent variations, leading to performance degradation or even model collapse.

> üîº Figure 14 presents a comparison of training loss curves for 120M and 1.2B parameter decoder-only language models trained using both standard 16-bit precision (bf16) and the 1-bit BitNet method.  The plot shows that in the early stages of training, BitNet's performance is comparable or even superior to the 16-bit models, primarily due to BitNet employing a higher learning rate.  However, as training progresses, the 16-bit models pull ahead, demonstrating the performance gap that widens further with larger models. This divergence highlights the limitations of low-bit, 1-bit training, particularly in later training stages, where the benefit of higher precision becomes increasingly crucial for achieving optimal model performance.  It provides visual evidence supporting the claim that native low-bit LLMs also favor undertrained models in a manner similar to post-training quantization.
