### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current robotic visuomotor policy learning methods face challenges. Diffusion-based models improve accuracy but are computationally expensive. Autoregressive models offer efficiency but lack precision.  This paper introduces CARP, a new approach aiming to solve these issues. 

CARP addresses these challenges by employing a two-stage approach: 1) Multi-scale action tokenization creates efficient representations; 2) Coarse-to-fine autoregressive prediction refines actions progressively.  This method achieves competitive accuracy, surpassing or matching existing methods while significantly improving inference speed (up to 10x faster).  This makes it well-suited for resource-constrained real-world robotic applications.

### In-depth insights


#### CARP's Novel Design
CARP introduces a novel approach to visuomotor policy learning by redefining the autoregressive process as **coarse-to-fine**, leveraging multi-scale action tokenization and a GPT-style transformer.  This contrasts sharply with traditional methods, such as diffusion models, which rely on iterative denoising.  **CARP's multi-scale tokenization** captures global action structure while maintaining temporal locality, overcoming the limitations of purely sequential predictions. The **coarse-to-fine refinement** allows for efficient generation of highly accurate and smooth action trajectories, surpassing the accuracy of diffusion methods and maintaining the efficiency of autoregressive ones.  This hybrid approach offers a compelling balance between performance and efficiency, making it highly suitable for real-world robotic applications. The use of **Cross-Entropy loss** further enhances the model's performance by allowing for multi-modal action distribution predictions. The overall design is elegantly straightforward, offering a powerful and efficient framework for generating complex actions and achieving robustness in challenging robotic tasks.

#### Multi-Scale Tokenization
The concept of "Multi-Scale Tokenization" offers a powerful approach to representing sequential data, such as action sequences in robotics.  Instead of treating each action as an independent unit, this method breaks down the sequence into multiple scales, each capturing different levels of granularity and temporal dependencies. **This hierarchical representation allows the model to simultaneously capture both short-term, fine-grained details and long-term, global patterns within the action sequence.**  The coarser scales provide a high-level overview of the action trajectory, while finer scales provide more detailed information.  This multi-scale approach is crucial for improving the model's ability to predict and generate complex actions, particularly in scenarios requiring long-range dependencies and precise coordination.  **By decoupling the representation of actions into multiple scales, the model can avoid the limitations of traditional autoregressive models, which often struggle to capture long-term dependencies.** A key advantage is the increased robustness and efficiency achieved by this approach. The use of a multi-scale autoencoder (VQVAE) to learn these token maps further enhances the model's ability to understand and generate diverse and accurate sequences. **The multi-scale tokens are designed to preserve temporal locality while capturing the overall structure of the action, providing a versatile and robust representation that improves prediction and control of robot actions.** This approach also has implications for other sequential data processing tasks, wherever a hierarchical structure exists.

#### Coarse-to-Fine Inference
A hypothetical "Coarse-to-Fine Inference" section in a research paper would likely detail a method for progressively refining predictions, starting from a coarse-grained overview and iteratively increasing the level of detail.  This approach contrasts with traditional methods that make single-step predictions.  The core idea is to leverage a hierarchical representation of data or a multi-scale model architecture.  **Early stages focus on capturing broad patterns**, while later stages concentrate on fine details and high precision. This strategy offers **several potential advantages**: improved efficiency by reducing the computational burden of high-resolution prediction at early stages, enhanced robustness to noise or uncertainties by first establishing a stable, coarse-grained understanding, and potentially better generalization capabilities by learning features at different levels of abstraction.  The process might involve sequentially applying different model components or refining intermediate predictions through iterative feedback mechanisms.  A key challenge is to efficiently integrate information across different scales while avoiding information loss.  Successful implementation would require careful design of the hierarchical representation, the optimization of the refinement process, and rigorous evaluation of its performance compared to single-step alternatives.  The detailed description would include algorithmic steps, architectural diagrams, and experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the coarse-to-fine strategy.

#### Sim & Real-World Tests
A robust evaluation of any robotics algorithm necessitates both simulation and real-world testing.  **Simulations** offer controlled environments for extensive experimentation, allowing for efficient parameter sweeps and exploration of the model's behavior across diverse scenarios.  However, **real-world tests** are crucial for validating the algorithm's generalizability and robustness, as real-world conditions are inherently unpredictable and complex.  A discrepancy between simulation and real-world performance could highlight limitations in the simulation model or reveal unexpected behaviors only apparent in the physical world. **Careful selection of simulation benchmarks** is critical to ensure that the simulation captures the essence of real-world challenges. The transition from simulation to real-world should be gradual, starting with simpler tasks in a controlled setting to gain confidence before proceeding to more complex real-world scenarios.  **Thorough analysis** that compares simulated and real-world results and highlights areas of agreement or disagreement is essential to build a trustworthy and reliable robotic system.

#### Future Work Directions
Future research directions stemming from the CARP paper could involve several key improvements.  **Extending CARP's multimodality** is crucial; while the paper addresses the limitations of unimodality in existing autoregressive methods, fully realizing CARP's potential for handling diverse sensory inputs (e.g., tactile, auditory) remains an important next step. This could involve exploring more sophisticated loss functions or architectural modifications to better handle multimodal data streams. Another promising avenue lies in **improving the model's efficiency and scalability**. While CARP demonstrates significant speed improvements over diffusion models, further optimization through algorithmic advancements or hardware acceleration techniques could enhance its real-world applicability in resource-constrained environments.  Furthermore, **leveraging the strengths of the GPT-style architecture** more fully should be explored.  This could involve investigating techniques for improved context utilization, possibly through the incorporation of more advanced attention mechanisms or the exploitation of techniques like mixture of experts. Finally, a significant area for future exploration involves **evaluating CARP in more complex and diverse robotic manipulation scenarios**.  The paper's experiments are impressive but more testing in real-world environments with greater variability and complexity would further establish its robustness and generalizability.  In essence, moving from simulated scenarios to real world applications with a greater diversity of tasks is key to showing CARP‚Äôs true potential and effectiveness.

Each step involves a conditional probability model (e.g., a neural network) that transforms the noisy action sequence based on the current observation and the action history. This iterative refinement process allows the policy to capture the complexity and uncertainty inherent in robot actions, but can also lead to computational inefficiencies due to multiple denoising steps.

Starting from the coarsest token map (r1), the model progressively refines the action sequence through finer-grained token maps (r2, r3... rK). An attention mechanism ensures that each token map considers only the previous maps during training. The training uses a cross-entropy loss function.  During inference, only the final, most detailed token map (rK) is decoded to generate a continuous action sequence.

> Table 3:  Multi-Stage Task Results (State Policy). In the Kitchen, pxùë•xitalic_x represents the frequency of interactions with xùë•xitalic_x or more objects. CARP outperforms BET, especially on challenging metrics like p4, and achieves competitive performance compared to DP, with fewer parameters and faster inference speed.

> üîº This table presents a comparison of the performance of different models on multiple robotic manipulation tasks using visual input.  The metrics include success rates (averaged across the top 3 model checkpoints for each task and overall), the number of model parameters, and the inference speed (time to generate 400 action predictions).  CARP demonstrates significantly improved performance (9-25% higher success rates) and efficiency (over 10x faster inference and substantially fewer parameters) compared to the baseline diffusion-based models.

> Table 4:  Multi-Task Simulation Results (Visual Policy). Success rates are averaged across the top three checkpoints for each task, as well as the overall average across all tasks. We also report parameter count and inference time for generating 400 actions. CARP outperforms diffusion-based policies by 9%-25% in average performance, with significantly fewer parameters and over 10√ó faster inference.
