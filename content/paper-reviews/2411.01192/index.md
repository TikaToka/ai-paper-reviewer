### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current multilingual embedding models often underperform on Arabic NLP tasks due to the language's unique morphology, diverse dialects, and cultural nuances.  Existing benchmarks also lack sufficient coverage of these aspects. This necessitates the development of Arabic-specific embedding models and a comprehensive evaluation framework. 



This paper introduces Swan, a family of Arabic-centric embedding models, focusing on both small and large scale applications. It also proposes ArabicMTEB, a benchmark that evaluates cross-lingual, multi-dialectal, and multi-cultural performance on eight diverse tasks. Swan-Large achieves state-of-the-art results, while Swan-Small surpasses Multilingual-E5-base. The research demonstrates that Swan models are dialectally and culturally aware and provide valuable resources for future NLP research.

### In-depth insights


#### Arabic Embeddings
The research paper explores the development of **Swan**, a family of Arabic embedding models designed to address limitations of existing multilingual models in capturing Arabic linguistic and cultural nuances.  Swan offers two variants: a smaller model based on ARBERTv2 and a larger one built on ArMistral, a pretrained Arabic large language model.  **ArabicMTEB**, a comprehensive benchmark suite, is introduced to evaluate these models across diverse tasks and datasets, showcasing Swan-Large's state-of-the-art performance.  The study highlights Swan's **dialectal and cultural awareness**, demonstrating its superior performance in various Arabic domains while offering **monetary efficiency**. The focus on Arabic-specific models and benchmarks represents a significant advancement in Arabic NLP, providing valuable resources for future research and applications.

#### Swan Model
The Swan model, introduced in this research paper, is a family of Arabic-centric embedding models designed to address both small-scale and large-scale applications.  It encompasses two main variants: **Swan-Small**, based on ARBERTv2, and **Swan-Large**, built on the ArMistral pretrained large language model.  A key strength of Swan is its **dialect-aware** and **culturally aware** nature, excelling in various Arabic domains while maintaining efficiency.  The models' performance is rigorously evaluated using a comprehensive benchmark, ArabicMTEB, demonstrating state-of-the-art results on several Arabic NLP tasks. The availability of both a small and large variant ensures applicability across diverse computational resource constraints, making Swan a significant contribution to Arabic NLP.

#### ArabicMTEB
ArabicMTEB is a **comprehensive benchmark** designed to evaluate Arabic text embedding models.  Unlike existing benchmarks that often lack sufficient Arabic coverage or neglect dialectal and cultural nuances, ArabicMTEB offers a **holistic assessment** using 94 datasets across eight diverse tasks. These tasks include **Arabic text retrieval**, **bitext mining**, **cross-lingual retrieval**, **re-ranking**, **semantic textual similarity**, **classification**, **pair classification**, and **clustering**.  The benchmark's strength lies in its ability to evaluate models across various linguistic aspects, including MSA and multiple dialects, and cultural domains, providing a **more realistic and applicable assessment** of embedding model capabilities for real-world Arabic NLP applications. Its inclusion of domain-specific and culturally aware datasets further enhances its value for researchers seeking to develop robust and nuanced Arabic language technologies.

#### Benchmarking
The benchmarking section of the research paper introduces **ArabicMTEB**, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate Arabic text embedding models.  Unlike existing benchmarks that lack sufficient Arabic language coverage or neglect dialectal and cultural nuances, **ArabicMTEB assesses performance across eight diverse tasks and 94 datasets**, encompassing various Arabic varieties and domains. This robust evaluation framework offers a more realistic and applicable assessment of embedding models' capabilities in real-world scenarios.  The key tasks within ArabicMTEB include **retrieval, classification, semantic similarity**, and **cross-lingual capabilities**, reflecting a holistic approach to model evaluation. The benchmark also considers **dialectal and cultural aspects** of the Arabic language, showcasing its commitment to thorough and nuanced evaluation in Arabic NLP.  By addressing the limitations of existing benchmarks, ArabicMTEB provides a valuable resource for future research and development in Arabic language technologies.

> üîº This table compares the performance of ArMistral, a new Arabic language model, against other state-of-the-art Arabic LLMs across various benchmarks.  The benchmarks assess capabilities in different areas including commonsense reasoning (ARC), natural language inference (Hellaswag), multiple-choice questions (Exams), general knowledge (MMLU), truthfulness (TruthfulQA), commonsense reasoning (ACVA), and Arabic-specific knowledge (AlGhafa).  The average score across all benchmarks provides a comprehensive comparison of the models' overall performance.
