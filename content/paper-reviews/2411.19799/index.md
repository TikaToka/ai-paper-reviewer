### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) show performance disparities across languages, hindering their deployment in many regions.  This is largely due to a **lack of high-quality evaluation resources** in low-resource languages and the **neglect of regional and cultural nuances** in benchmark creation.  Current benchmarks often translate from English, ignoring cultural contexts.

To address this, the researchers created INCLUDE, a multilingual benchmark comprising **197,243 question-answer pairs** from diverse exams across **44 languages**.  INCLUDE tests LLMs' knowledge and reasoning abilities in various regional settings, using questions from educational and professional exams, thus evaluating performance in their intended environments. The **release of INCLUDE** provides a crucial resource for researchers and developers in the field.

### In-depth insights


#### Multilingual LLM Gaps
The concept of "Multilingual LLM Gaps" highlights the significant disparities in performance between large language models (LLMs) across different languages.  **These gaps aren't merely technical limitations; they reflect deep-seated biases and inequalities in the data used to train these models.**  The overrepresentation of high-resource languages like English creates a feedback loop: models perform well on English, leading to further development focused on it, while low-resource languages are neglected. This disparity **exacerbates existing digital divides**, hindering access to beneficial AI technologies for speakers of low-resource languages.  Furthermore, the methods used to create multilingual benchmarks often rely on translation from high-resource languages, failing to capture the nuances of regional and cultural contexts.  **Addressing these gaps requires a multifaceted approach.** This includes actively developing high-quality evaluation resources in diverse languages, employing data collection techniques that are more inclusive and representative, and designing more culturally sensitive benchmarks that account for regional knowledge.  **Only with concerted effort to mitigate these biases can we ensure fair and equitable access to the benefits of advanced LLMs for all.**

#### INCLUDE Benchmark
The INCLUDE benchmark is a significant contribution to multilingual language understanding evaluation.  Its strength lies in its **comprehensive nature**, encompassing a large number of multiple-choice questions across 44 languages, derived from diverse sources including academic exams and professional certifications.  This broad scope allows for a nuanced understanding of model performance, going beyond simple translation tasks and assessing proficiency in real-world language use.  Furthermore, **INCLUDE's focus on regional knowledge** is crucial, as it directly addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks that often lack cultural and contextual awareness.  By including questions that require regional understanding, INCLUDE offers a more equitable and comprehensive evaluation framework that better reflects the diversity and challenges of real-world applications of multilingual LLMs.  The benchmark's impact is magnified by its public release, which will facilitate further research and development in this critical area. However, the **reliance on existing benchmarks** for a portion of the data, while acknowledging and accounting for dataset contamination, may necessitate further analysis to ensure complete independence and unbiased evaluation.

#### Regional Knowledge
The concept of "Regional Knowledge" in the context of multilingual large language models (LLMs) is crucial.  The paper highlights how **current LLMs often struggle with questions requiring regional knowledge**, showcasing a significant performance gap across different languages. This gap stems from the fact that existing multilingual benchmarks often translate resources from high-resource languages like English, ignoring the unique cultural and regional nuances of other environments.  This underscores the **importance of using locally sourced, high-quality evaluation resources to accurately measure LLM performance**.  The authors stress that benchmarks must **reflect actual language usage scenarios** to address the limitations of translating existing resources, which can lead to biases and inaccuracies. Creating evaluations based on regional contexts is essential for equitable and effective LLM deployment, **reducing the digital divide** and fostering a more inclusive development of AI tools.

#### Prompting Strategies
Prompting strategies in large language model (LLM) evaluation are crucial for uncovering valuable insights into model capabilities and limitations.  **Effective prompting techniques** can significantly influence the performance of LLMs across diverse tasks and languages.  The choice of prompting methods (e.g., zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) directly impacts the model's ability to generate accurate and coherent responses. **In-language prompting**, where instructions are provided in the native language of the task, often yields better results compared to using a common language like English, especially for tasks requiring regional or cultural knowledge.  **However, the use of a common language might help in scenarios with limited resources for specific languages**. Investigating the impact of various prompting strategies on LLMs will reveal important information on how to develop and refine them.  Further analysis might even explore the impact of incorporating regional contexts into the prompts to improve the performance on questions requiring such knowledge.

#### Future Directions
Future research should prioritize expanding INCLUDE's language coverage to encompass more under-resourced languages and dialects, thereby reducing evaluation biases.  **Improving data collection methodology is vital** to ensure accurate representation of regional knowledge, perhaps by refining the exam selection process and incorporating more rigorous quality control measures.  Investigating the impact of various prompting strategies on model performance across languages and regions is crucial to optimize evaluation methodologies.  **A deeper investigation into why specific model architectures or training paradigms perform better on certain languages than others is warranted.** This includes exploring factors like the size and diversity of training data, and the inherent linguistic properties of the languages themselves.  Finally, understanding how to better incorporate cultural and regional context into the models' training data is a key challenge that requires focused investigation, potentially through the development of innovative data augmentation techniques.

By separating correctly formatted answers from those with formatting issues, the table provides a nuanced view of model performance, distinguishing between true comprehension failures and problems with output formatting. The analysis is further broken down by whether prompts were given in the native language or in English, offering insights into the effect of prompting language on both the raw accuracy and the ability of the model to produce correctly formatted outputs.

> Table 3: Results on Include-base for In-language and English prompting strategies. Total Accuracy represents the raw accuracy of the model for answering Include questions in each respective subset. Answer Accuracy represents the accuracy of the model when only considering samples where an answer is extracted from the model‚Äôs output in the correct response format. Formatting Errors (%) describes the percentage of model responses that are not formatted correctly and so do not output any answer option. We mark these incorrect by default in Total Accuracy and do not include them when computing Answer Accuracy.

> üîº This table details the annotation schema used to categorize the exams included in the INCLUDE benchmark.  It maps high-level academic areas (like Humanities or STEM) to more specific academic fields (e.g., History, Biology). Critically, it also assigns a regionality label to each exam, indicating whether the knowledge required to answer the questions is region-agnostic (doesn't require regional knowledge), culture-related (requires cultural understanding of a region), region-explicit (explicitly requires knowledge about laws or regulations specific to a region), or region-implicit (implicitly relies on regional context).  While the table shows the most frequent regionality label for each exam, it's important to note that each exam in the dataset was individually labeled with one of these four regionality categories.

The Label column lists the most likely regionality label for these exams in our dataset (e.g., region-{agnostic, implicit, explicit} or cultural), though all exams from which we collect data are individually labeled with a regionality category. The first label is the most frequent one.

The table is broken down by language, academic field (e.g., History, Economics, STEM subjects), and the type of regional knowledge required to answer the question (agnostic, culture-related, explicit, implicit).  The accuracy of GPT-4's responses is shown for each combination of language, field, and regional knowledge type, providing a detailed view of its performance across diverse contexts and language groups.  Fields with fewer than 30 examples were excluded from the analysis to ensure statistical reliability.

For each language, it shows the accuracy achieved at different values of k (50, 100, 200, and 512 tokens). The 'Total gain' column indicates the improvement in accuracy observed when increasing the generation length from k=50 to k=512. This allows for analyzing the impact of increasing the response length on the model's performance and identifying which languages benefit most from longer generations.
