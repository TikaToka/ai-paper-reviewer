### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

This research tackles the problem of limited control in current text-to-image (T2I) models.  Existing methods can replicate concepts from reference images, but lack fine-grained control over individual components within those concepts. This paper introduces a new task called "component-controllable personalization," aiming to modify specific components (like hair, eyes, or a building's roof) while maintaining the overall concept.  They propose a new framework, MagicTailor, which uses two key techniques: 1) Dynamic Masked Degradation (DM-Deg) to reduce unwanted visual elements ('semantic pollution'), and 2) Dual-Stream Balancing (DS-Bal) to ensure balanced learning of different components ('semantic imbalance').  MagicTailor significantly outperforms existing methods in experiments, showing superior text alignment, image fidelity, and generation quality.  It also demonstrates potential for integration with other generative tools, suggesting broader applicability in various creative fields.

> Figure 2: Major challenges in component-controllable personalization. (a) Semantic pollution: (i) Undesired visual elements may inadvertently disturb the personalized concept. (ii) A simple mask-out strategy is ineffective and causes unintended compositions, whereas (iii) our DM-Deg effectively suppresses unwanted visual semantics, preventing such pollution. (b) Semantic imbalance: (i) Simultaneously learning the concept and component can lead to imbalance, resulting in concept or component distortion (here we present a case for the former). (ii) Our DS-Bal ensures balanced learning, enhancing personalization performance.

> Figure 3: Pipeline overview of MagicTailor. Using reference images as the inputs, MagicTailor fine-tunes a T2I diffusion model to learn both the target concept and component, enabling the generation of images that seamlessly integrate the component into the concept. Two key techniques, Dynamic Masked Degradation (DM-Deg, see Section 3.2) and Dual-Stream Balancing (DS-Bal, see Section 3.3), address the challenges of semantic pollution and semantic imbalance, respectively. For clarity, only one image per concept/component is presented and the warm-up stage is not depicted.
