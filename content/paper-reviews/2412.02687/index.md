### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current one-step diffusion models for image generation suffer from training instability and lack negative prompt support, limiting their flexibility.  **Existing solutions often involve computationally expensive or resource-intensive methods.** The lack of negative prompt capabilities also reduces the practicality and effectiveness of such models. 



To address these issues, this paper introduces SNOOPI.  **SNOOPI employs Proper Guidance-SwiftBrush (PG-SB) to enhance training stability by using a random-scale classifier-free guidance.** It also introduces a novel training-free method called Negative-Away Steer Attention (NASA) for seamlessly integrating negative prompts into the generation process. **These methods significantly improve the performance of one-step models across multiple benchmarks, setting a new state-of-the-art.**

### In-depth insights


#### One-Step Distillation
One-step distillation, as explored in the context of text-to-image diffusion models, presents a compelling approach to significantly improve efficiency without compromising the quality of generated images.  The core idea revolves around **distilling the knowledge of a complex, multi-step diffusion model into a simpler, one-step model**, thereby accelerating the image generation process. This technique offers substantial practical advantages by reducing computational costs and inference times, making it particularly attractive for real-world applications where speed and resource efficiency are crucial.  However, achieving successful one-step distillation faces several key challenges, including the **instability of existing training methods** (such as those relying on a fixed guidance scale) and the **absence of support for negative prompt guidance**.  The latter significantly limits the level of control over generated image details and stylistic features.  Addressing these challenges requires innovative methods to stabilize training, enhance robustness across diverse model architectures, and effectively integrate negative prompting capabilities to enable more precise control during generation.  The paper, therefore, focuses on developing novel approaches for overcoming these limitations, thereby unlocking the full potential of one-step diffusion models for high-quality, efficient image synthesis.

#### PG-SB Guidance
The proposed PG-SB (Proper Guidance - SwiftBrush) method tackles the instability issues in existing one-step diffusion model distillation techniques.  **The core innovation is the introduction of a randomized guidance scale during training**, instead of using a fixed scale as in previous methods like SwiftBrush. This approach enhances training stability by broadening the output distributions of the teacher models. **The varied guidance scale prevents overfitting to specific scales** and improves the robustness of the VSD loss, making it less sensitive to the choice of model backbone.  This dynamic adjustment of guidance improves the generalization capabilities and overall efficiency of the distillation process, leading to more robust and stable one-step models.  The results highlight PG-SB's effectiveness in achieving competitive performance across diverse model architectures, showcasing its adaptability and improved stability over the original SwiftBrush method.  **This is particularly relevant given the importance of efficiency and stability in practical applications** of one-step diffusion models. 

#### NASA Attention
The proposed 'NASA Attention' mechanism offers a novel approach to integrating negative prompts into one-step diffusion models, a significant improvement over existing methods.  **Unlike classifier-free guidance (CFG), which struggles with one-step models due to their lack of iterative refinement, NASA operates in the intermediate feature space of the diffusion model.** This allows for selective suppression of unwanted features by modulating cross-attention layers, thus directly influencing the attention weights assigned to negative prompt features. **This feature-space manipulation is more effective than manipulating text embeddings alone,** resulting in significantly cleaner and more aligned image generation.  The use of cross-attention layers is particularly insightful, as it leverages their ability to capture semantic relationships between image regions and text features for precise control.  **NASA's training-free nature and adaptability to diverse backbones** are also crucial advantages, enhancing its practicality and ease of integration into various one-step diffusion models.  However, future work could explore broader applicability to architectures lacking cross-attention and optimal scaling strategies for negative feature removal.

#### SNOOPI Framework
The SNOOPI framework presents a novel approach to one-step diffusion model distillation, focusing on enhanced stability and negative prompt integration.  **Proper Guidance-SwiftBrush (PG-SB)** addresses instability issues in existing methods by introducing a randomized guidance scale during training, leading to more robust performance across different model backbones.  This dynamic approach avoids the limitations of fixed guidance scales, enhancing the adaptability of the distillation process.  Furthermore, **Negative-Away Steer Attention (NASA)** provides a unique solution for incorporating negative prompts into one-step generation. Unlike previous methods, NASA works directly within the cross-attention layers, effectively steering the attention mechanism away from undesired image features without the need for iterative refinement, a critical advancement for efficient image synthesis.  In essence, SNOOPI combines improved training stability with the ability to control image generation through negative prompts, achieving a new state-of-the-art in one-step diffusion models.  **The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both PG-SB and NASA,** showcasing significant improvements in image quality and control metrics across various benchmarks.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore several promising avenues.  **Improving the stability and efficiency of one-step diffusion models** remains crucial. While SNOOPI offers advancements, further investigation into the VSD loss function and its interaction with various model architectures is warranted.  **Developing more sophisticated negative prompt integration techniques** beyond NASA could unlock finer-grained control over generated images.  **Extending SNOOPI's capabilities to few-step models** would bridge the gap between speed and fidelity. Finally, **exploring the application of SNOOPI to other generative tasks** beyond image synthesis, such as video or 3D model generation, presents exciting opportunities.  This would involve adapting the core principles of proper guidance and negative steer attention to the unique challenges of these different modalities.  Ultimately, the goal is to create even more efficient and versatile generative models capable of high-quality outputs with minimal computational resources.

> üîº Figure 2 illustrates the impact of different training approaches on the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) score, a metric measuring the quality of generated images.  The x-axis represents training iterations, while the y-axis represents the FID 2K score.  Three different models (SwiftBrush, SwiftBrush with the 'Two Time-scale Update Rule' modification, and the proposed PG-SB method) are compared for two different diffusion model backbones (SDv1.5 and PixArt-Œ±). The graph clearly shows that SwiftBrush and its modification exhibit unstable training, leading to significant fluctuations in FID scores. Conversely, the PG-SB approach demonstrates much more stable training, resulting in a consistently lower and more desirable FID score, indicating better image quality.

For multi-step Stable Diffusion models, results are shown using the CFG scale that yielded the best FID score.  Note that some results are taken from previously published works (denoted by ‚Ä†) while others are replicated by the authors of the current paper (denoted by ‚Ä°), using publicly available checkpoints; missing values are indicated by '-'.  The table allows for a direct comparison of the efficiency (NFEs), image quality (FID, CLIP, Precision, Recall), and resource requirements (Image-free) of different approaches.

> üîº This table presents a comparison of success rates in removing unwanted features from images generated by different models.  It compares the performance of four models (SDXL-LCM, SDXL-DMD2 4-step, SDXL-DMD2 1-step, and PG-SB 1-step) before and after incorporating the NASA module, which aims to enhance the control over unwanted features in image generation.  The success rate is measured as the percentage of generated images where the specified negative feature is successfully excluded, given a positive and negative prompt pair.  For each model, the success rate is reported for several different positive/negative prompt combinations.

> üîº This table presents a comparison of HPSv2 (Human Preference Score v2) scores across different text-to-image generation models.  The models are grouped by the underlying Stable Diffusion version (1.5, 2.1, or PixArt-a) used as a backbone. For each model and backbone, the table shows HPSv2 scores broken down by image category (Anime, Photo, Concept Art, Paintings). It includes scores for both baseline models and models with enhancements, particularly those involving the PG-SB (Proper Guidance - SwiftBrush) method and the NASA (Negative-Away Steer Attention) method proposed in this paper.  Scores marked with ‚Ä† represent values reported in the original publications, while those marked with ‚Ä° are scores re-generated by the authors of this paper based on publicly available model checkpoints to ensure fair comparison across all methods.
