### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Creating animatable 3D characters usually involves extensive manual work for rigging and skinning. Existing automated tools often have limitations, such as requiring manual annotations or being restricted to specific character types and poses.  This limits their effectiveness and practicality for modern creative industries that require a wide variety of character designs and animation styles. 

This paper introduces Make-It-Animatable, a data-driven method that significantly speeds up the process.  It generates high-quality rigging, skinning, and pose transformations in less than one second, regardless of the input character's shape or pose. The framework uses a particle-based shape autoencoder and structure-aware modeling to ensure both accuracy and robustness, even with unconventional character designs.  This offers a significant improvement over existing methods in both speed and quality, opening up exciting new possibilities for applications requiring rapid and highly customizable character animations, such as virtual reality, video games, and real-time simulations.

Given a 3D character model (either a mesh or a point cloud represented by 3D Gaussian Splats), regardless of its pose or shape, the system automatically generates a rig, performs skinning, and resets the pose to a neutral position, all within one second. The resulting model has a detailed skeleton and allows for animation.

### In-depth insights


#### Animatable 3D Char
The concept of 'Animatable 3D Characters' represents a significant advancement in computer graphics and animation.  Creating realistic and expressive 3D characters that can convincingly move and interact within a virtual environment requires solving several complex technical challenges.  **Rigging** and **skinning** are crucial processes: rigging establishes the underlying skeletal structure, while skinning defines how the character's surface deforms in response to skeletal movements.  Traditional methods rely heavily on manual artistry, which is time-consuming and expensive. The research paper explores efficient data-driven approaches to automate these processes.  The innovation lies in techniques that allow for rapid and accurate rigging and skinning, handling diverse character designs and poses, including those with non-standard anatomies or extreme proportions.  **Particle-based shape encoding**, coupled with **structure-aware modelling**, may address limitations of traditional mesh-based methods, resulting in greater flexibility and efficiency.  The **speed** with which this automation can be performed is highlighted as a key achievement, enabling applications requiring real-time or interactive character animation. The overall impact is to lower the barrier to entry for character animation, accelerating development workflows in fields such as gaming and virtual reality.

#### Particle-Based AE
The heading 'Particle-Based AE,' likely referring to a Particle-Based Autoencoder, suggests a novel approach to representing 3D character geometry.  This method likely leverages the power of autoencoders, neural networks trained to learn compressed representations of data, but adapts them to handle particle-based representations of 3D shapes. This is significant because **particle systems offer flexibility in representing complex shapes and deformations**, unlike mesh-based methods which can struggle with highly detailed or irregular surfaces.  The autoencoder likely compresses the high-dimensional particle data into a lower-dimensional latent space, capturing the essential features of the character's shape. This compressed representation can then be decoded to reconstruct the original particle data, potentially allowing for manipulations and animations.  The advantage of this approach is that **it can handle various input formats**, not just meshes. The use of a particle-based system likely makes the method robust to noise, variations, and non-uniform sampling of points, ensuring greater generalization.  Further, this approach could facilitate efficient processing compared to other methods, particularly useful for real-time applications requiring fast rigging and animation. The focus on particles offers **advantages in terms of flexibility and scalability**, especially when dealing with high-resolution models or complex animations. The effectiveness of this approach would depend on the architecture of the autoencoder, the choice of loss function, and the training data used.

#### Coarse-to-Fine Rig
The concept of a "Coarse-to-Fine Rig" in 3D character animation suggests a hierarchical approach to rigging, improving both accuracy and efficiency.  A coarse stage initially identifies major skeletal features, providing a foundational structure. This initial, approximate rigging is computationally inexpensive and focuses on the overall pose and proportions.  Subsequently, a fine-tuning phase refines the details, particularly in areas such as hands and fingers, which are challenging due to their intricate geometry and high degrees of freedom. This two-stage approach leverages the strengths of both speed (coarse) and precision (fine). **The coarse stage offers a robust initial guess, minimizing the computational burden on the refinement process.**  **The fine stage builds upon this foundation to handle complex, fine-grained structures accurately, rather than starting from scratch.** This strategy is particularly valuable for handling various poses and character morphologies, making it versatile and efficient. Overall, a Coarse-to-Fine Rig offers a powerful and practical solution for building animatable 3D characters quickly and accurately.

#### Structure-Aware Model
The concept of a 'Structure-Aware Model' in the context of 3D character animation is crucial for achieving natural and realistic movements.  A standard approach, like Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), often falls short when dealing with characters possessing unconventional morphologies or poses.  **Structure awareness** addresses this limitation by explicitly incorporating skeletal topology and relationships into the animation process.  This is achieved by integrating the hierarchical relationships between bones (parent-child connections) directly into the model's architecture.  This approach is in contrast to methods that treat bone transformations independently, thereby potentially leading to unnatural or disconnected movements.  **By encoding skeletal structure**, the model can predict bone transformations that are contextually appropriate, resulting in more lifelike deformations. **Causal attention mechanisms** are particularly useful in this context, allowing the model to leverage information from ancestral bones to accurately predict the pose of descendant bones, mirroring the natural biomechanical constraints of a skeleton.  The effectiveness of this strategy is demonstrated through enhanced accuracy and naturalness in character animations, particularly in challenging areas such as finger articulation and complex poses.

#### Future Works
Future work could explore several promising avenues. **Extending the framework's adaptability to non-bipedal characters** is crucial, requiring modifications to the skeleton representation and potentially incorporating alternative rigging techniques.  **Improving the handling of highly detailed or complex geometries** would enhance the system's versatility, addressing potential challenges in accurately capturing fine details during rigging and skinning.  This might involve exploring advanced mesh processing methods or incorporating higher-resolution input representations.  The current method employs a fixed skeleton topology, which limits flexibility. **Investigating methods for learning or automatically generating appropriate skeleton structures** would enhance the framework's capacity for diverse character types.  **Incorporating physics simulation into the animation process** would create a more realistic and dynamic outcome. This would add complexity, but could significantly improve the quality of character animation. Finally, the efficiency of the framework could be further optimized, **potentially through exploring more efficient deep learning architectures or algorithmic improvements**. These refinements could make the tool even more practical for real-time applications and large-scale productions.

> 🔼 This figure illustrates the pipeline of the Make-It-Animatable framework, which efficiently generates animation-ready 3D characters from various input formats.  The process begins with coarse joint localization using a pre-trained model, refining the shape representation.  A particle-based autoencoder then encodes the shape into a neural field.  Spatial and learnable queries decode this field to generate blend weights and bone structures.  Finally, a structure-aware model refines bone predictions to better match skeletal topology, resulting in a fully animatable 3D character.

The transformer processes per-bone shape embeddings, combining them with latent information from parent bones (using autoregressive outputs during inference or ground truth values during training). This combined information, along with features from ancestral bones, is refined through masked causal attention. Finally, the transformer decodes the enriched shape and structure embeddings to generate bone attributes (joint positions and pose transformations). The inference process is sequential, predicting the attributes of child bones based on the already-predicted attributes of their parent bones.

The upper part shows the coarse stage, where the input 3D shape is uniformly sampled, and only bone positions are predicted using data augmentation (random 3D rotations). This aims to make the coarse model robust to various global transformations. The lower part illustrates the fine stage.  Here, canonical transformation and hierarchical sampling are applied to refine the shape representation based on the ground-truth bone positions obtained in the coarse stage. During inference, a 3D character is first processed by the coarse framework to predict bone positions; these positions then guide the creation of the refined shape representation in the fine framework. The body prior loss is directly applied to bone positions in both stages, and the ground-truth bones are used as a proxy for pose prediction to indirectly optimize the pose.

> Figure S1:  The coarse (upper) and fine (lower) stages of training our framework. In the coarse stage, the input shape is uniformly sampled and only the bone positions are predicted. We apply data augmentation to the inputs via random 3D rotations, so that the coarse model is generalizable to global transformations of in-the-wild cases with an acceptable accuracy. In the fine stage, we apply canonical transformation and hierarchical sampling to the shapes in advance based on the ground-truth bone positions. Then during inference, a 3D character is fed into the coarse framework to get its bone positions, which guide the establishment of coarse-to-fine shape representation later in the fine framework. Note that the body prior loss (Sec. 3.4) is directly applied to the bone positions. As for pose prediction, we take the ground-truth bones as a proxy and use the predicted pose to transform them, thereby indirectly affecting the pose optimization.

The comparison focuses on a subset of the test dataset containing bipedal humanoid characters from the paper [xu2019predicting].  The metrics used for comparison include Intersection over Union (IoU), precision, recall, and Chamfer distances (CD-J2J, CD-J2B, CD-B2B). These metrics evaluate the accuracy and quality of the skeleton predictions, providing a detailed assessment of the performance of both methods on this specific type of character.
