Explain your an- swer step by step</td><td>To find the average of a set of numbers, you add up all the numbers in the set and then divide the sum by the total number of numbers in the set. Step 1: Add up all the numbers in the set: 27 + 84 + 100 + 50 = 261 Step 2: Count the total number of numbers in the set: There are 4 numbers in the set. Step 3: Divide the sum by the total number of num- bers in the set: 261 รท 4 = 65.25 So, the average of 27, 84, 100, and 50 is 65.25.</td><td>Step 1: Add up all the numbers in the set: 27 + 84 + 100 + 50 = 261 Step 2: Count the total number of numbers in the set: There are 4 numbers in the set. Step 3: Divide the sum by the total number of num- bers in the set: 261 รท 4 = 1327.75 The answer is 1327.75</td></tr></table>
