Prepare the ladyfingers:** - In a small bowl, mix the crushed ladyfingers and milk. - Let sit for 5 minutes to absorb the liquid. - Drain any excess liquid. **2. Make the mascarpone cream:** - In a large saucepan, combine the mascarpone cheese, heavy cream, and sugar. - Heat over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and becomes creamy. - Remove from heat and whisk in the vanilla extract. **3. Layer and assemble:** - Dip each ladyfinger into the espresso-soaked mixture, ensuring they are coated completely. - Spread a thin layer of mascarpone cream on the bottom of a serving dish. - Top with a layer of ladyfingers. - Pour the mascarpone cream mixture over the ladyfingers. **4. Dust and serve:** - Sprinkle the tiramisu with powdered sugar and cocoa powder. - Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator for later. **Tips:** * For the best flavor, use high-quality ingredients. * Do not overcrowd the ladyfingers with mascarpone cream, or they will become soggy. * Serve the tiramisu at room temperature or slightly chilled. * Tiramisu can be made ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. **Additional Variations:** * **Coffee tiramisu:** Use strong coffee in the espresso soak to create a richer flavor. * **Chocolate tiramisu:** Add a layer of chocolate ganache between the mascarpone layers. * **Vanilla tiramisu:** Add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the mascarpone cream. | \u201d1. **Gather Ingredients** - 2 cups ladyfingers, crumbled - 1 cup mascarpone cheese, softened - 2 cups granulated sugar - 0\u03060bd cup strong coffee or espresso - 2 teaspoons vanilla extract - 1 cup whole milk - 0\u03060bd cup heavy cream - 2 large eggs yolks - 1 large egg white 2. **Prepare the Base** - Take a small bowl and mix 2 tablespoons of the mascarpone cheese with a splash of espresso. Add the mascarpone mixture to a small casserole dish. 3. **Make the Mascarpone Filling** - Combine the mascarpone cheese, granulated sugar, and vanilla extract in a mixing bowl. Beat the ingredients together until smooth and creamy. - Set aside. 4. **Prepare the Coffee Base** - Brew 2 cups of strong coffee or espresso. Add the diluted coffee to a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. 5. **Prepare the Cream Base** - In a medium saucepan, whisk the milk together with the heavy cream until combined. 6. **Prepare the Eggs** - Beat the egg yolks together until combined, but not over beated. 7. **Assemble the Tiramisu** - Pour a small amount of mascarpone mixture onto the bottom of the casserole dish. 8. **Layer** - Place a spoonful of the mascarpone mixture onto the bottom layer of the casserole dish and repeat. 9. **Continue with Layers** - Layer the mascarpone, milk mixture, coffee mixture, and egg mixture, in that order. 10. **Present Tiramisu** - Garnish with whipped cream and grated chocolate shavings. **Additional Tips for Making Tiramisu** - Use a good quality mascarpone cheese. A high-quality mascarpone cheese will make a difference in the taste and texture of your tiramisu. - Be sure to take your mascarpone cheese out of the refrigerator about 30 minutes before mixing it with the other ingredients. - Be careful not to add too much sugar to the mascarpone mixture. It should be sweet, but not overly sweet. - When layering the tiramisu, be sure to keep the layers thin. This will prevent the tiramisu from becoming dense. - Serve your tiramisu immediately after it is assembled. **Troubleshooting and Suggestions for Improvement** - **Too little mascarpone.** If the mascarpone mixture is too thin, it will not set properly. - **Too much mascarpone.** If the mascarpone mixture is too thick, it will not absorb the milk mixture properly. - **Not enough powdered sugar.** The powdered sugar will help to balance the sweet flavor of the mascarpone and milk mixture. - **Not enough espresso.** If you don\u2019t add enough espresso to the coffee base, it will not be strong enough to set properly. **Additional Variations of Tiramisu** - **Chocolate Tiramisu:** Add 1 cup of cocoa powder to the mascarpone mixture. - **Vanilla Tiramisu:** Add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the mascarpone mixture. - **Fruity Tiramisu:** Mix in a variety of fruits, including blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, and peaches. **Conclusion** Tiramisu is a simple and delicious dessert that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. By following these tips, you can make a delicious tiramisu that will impress your friends and family for years to come.\u201d | ", "caption": "Table 2: Example responses from the Base Gemma model and using our length neologism.", "description": "\uc774 \ud45c\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 Gemma \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc800\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uae38\uc774 \uc2e0\uc5b4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \uc608\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \uae30\ubcf8 Gemma \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uae38\uc774(600-1000 \ub2e8\uc5b4)\ub97c \ucda9\uc871\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uc9e7\uc740 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae38\uc774 \uc2e0\uc5b4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uae38\uc774\uc758 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \ub450 \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uae38\uc774 \uc2e0\uc5b4\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc751\ub2f5 \uae38\uc774\ub97c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "section": "5.
