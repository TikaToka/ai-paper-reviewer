[{"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19324/x1.png", "caption": "Figure 1: Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding (RSD). This diagram illustrates how RSD improves upon standard speculative decoding (SD) by incorporating reward-guided selection. SD strictly enforces exact token matching between the draft and target model, leading to unnecessary computations when mismatched tokens are discarded. In contrast, RSD evaluates draft outputs based on reward signals r\ud835\udc5fritalic_r and selectively refines them, reducing reliance on exact matching and improving efficiency. The process starts with a small and fast draft model generating preliminary results, followed by a larger and more reliable target model verifying and refining predictions. Darker background regions indicate higher computational costs, showing how SD wastes resources on rejected tokens, whereas RSD reduces unnecessary steps by accepting useful draft outputs even when they do not exactly match, balancing efficiency and accuracy.", "description": "\uadf8\ub9bc 1\uc740 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1-\uc720\ub3c4 \ucd94\ub860\uc801 \ub514\ucf54\ub529(RSD) \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc801 \ub514\ucf54\ub529(SD)\uc740 \ucd08\uc548 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ubaa9\ud45c \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc77c\uce58 \uc5ec\ubd80\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, RSD\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638(r)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd08\uc548 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc77c\uce58 \uc5ec\ubd80\uc640 \uad00\uacc4\uc5c6\uc774 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub4ec\uc5b4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \uc791\uace0 \ube60\ub978 \ucd08\uc548 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 1\ucc28 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \ub4a4 \ub354 \ud06c\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5b4\ub450\uc6b4 \ubc30\uacbd \uc601\uc5ed\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, SD\ub294 \uac70\ubd80\ub41c \ud1a0\ud070\uc5d0 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, RSD\ub294 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc904\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "section": "2.
