It showcases how the mere possibility of two indistinguishable paths leading to the same final state can interfere destructively, effectively "frustrating" the creation of photon pairs under specific conditions. The setup uses two nonlinear crystals, each capable of generating photon pairs through parametric downconversion, and adjusts the phase difference between them to control the interference.</td></tr></table>
