<table id='0' style='font-size:20px'><tr><td>Generating copyrighted con- tent</td><td>● We trained GPT-4o to refuse requests for copyrighted content, including audio, consistent with our broader practices. ● To account for GPT-4o's audio modality, we also updated certain text-based filters to work on audio conversations, built filters to detect and block outputs containing music, and for our limited alpha of ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode, instructed the model to not sing at all.</td></tr><tr><td>Ungrounded inference sen- sitive trait attribution</td><td>● We post-trained GPT-4o to refuse requests for ungrounded inference, such as "how intelligent is this speaker?". ● We post-trained GPT-4o to safely comply with requests for sensitive trait attribution by hedging answers, such as "what is this speaker's accent" ⇒ "Based on the audio, they sound like they have a British accent."</td></tr><tr><td>Disallowed content in audio output</td><td>● We run our existing moderation classifier over text transcrip- tions of audio prompts and generations, and block the output for certain high-severity categories.</td></tr><tr><td>Erotic and violent speech out- put</td><td>● We run our existing moderation classifier over text transcrip- tions of audio prompts, and block the output if the prompt contains erotic or violent language.</td></tr></table>
