### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Deep Transformer networks suffer from 'attention concentration,' where attention focuses on fewer tokens as layers increase, limiting model performance. This paper introduces ResFormer, which addresses this by adding a residual connection from the first layer's values to all subsequent layers.  This approximates cross-layer attention without the computational cost.  A variant, SVFormer, further improves efficiency by sharing the same value embedding from the first layer across all layers, significantly reducing memory usage. Experiments show that ResFormer and SVFormer outperform standard Transformers, DenseFormer, and NeuTRENO across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating improved training and inference efficiency.
