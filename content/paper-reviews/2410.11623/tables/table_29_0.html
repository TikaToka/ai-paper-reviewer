<table id='5' style='font-size:14px'><tr><td colspan="2">Question: Please generate the rationale for determining why I did not complete the task to sprinkle flour on the dough. Answer: 1. The video shows the action of rubbing flour on the dough, not sprinkling it. 2. The hand is seen directly applying flour to the dough, indicating a rubbing motion rather than a sprinkling motion. 3. The flour is being spread across the dough surface by hand, which is consistent with rubbing not sprinkling.</td></tr><tr><td>GPT-40 w/ 8 Frames: The table surface is clean and there is no visible flour on it.</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>GPT-4o w/ 32 Frames: The flour is still in the bag and not on the table.</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>Qwen-VL-7B-Chat: I did not complete the task of sprinkle flour on the dough because the flour was already on the counter, and I did not need to add more.</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>LWM-Chat-32k-Jax-7B: The reason that I did not complete the task to sprinkle flour onto the dough is that I was not in the mood to bake. The video shows that the person was baking a cake and sprinkling flour on the dough before baking it. The caption mentions that the person was not in the mood to bake, but it is possible that they were not in the mood for baking at that moment.</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>GroundingGPT-7B: The rationale is that the video does not show the completion of the task, so it is not possible to determine why it was not complete.</td><td>0.0</td></tr></table>
