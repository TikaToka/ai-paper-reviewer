### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Deploying large multimodal language models (MLLMs) on mobile phones is hindered by limitations in memory and processing power.  Existing solutions often struggle with slow speeds and high resource consumption, limiting their practicality for real-time applications.  This is a critical issue because mobile phones offer a seamless platform for integrating MLLMs into everyday tasks. 

This paper introduces BlueLM-V-3B, which tackles these challenges via a novel co-design strategy.  This involves optimizing the model's architecture for smaller size and faster inference, as well as implementing system optimizations tailored for mobile hardware.  **BlueLM-V-3B achieves a generation speed of 24.4 tokens/s on a MediaTek Dimensity 9300 processor and attains the highest average score among comparable models on the OpenCompass benchmark.**  The results demonstrate a significant step toward making MLLMs more readily available and usable on mobile platforms.

### In-depth insights


#### Mobile MLLM Design
Designing Mobile MLLMs presents unique challenges due to **limited computational resources and memory constraints** of mobile devices.  Effective mobile MLLM design necessitates a multi-pronged approach encompassing **model compression techniques**, such as quantization and pruning, to reduce model size and improve inference speed.  **Efficient architectures** are crucial, potentially employing lightweight models or specialized designs for mobile hardware.   Furthermore, **system-level optimizations** are key, including efficient memory management, optimized data transfer between CPU/GPU/NPU, and hardware-aware parallelization strategies.  Addressing the dynamic resolution problem in image processing within MLLMs is vital for both accuracy and efficiency on mobile devices.  A successful design will balance model performance, speed, and resource usage, ensuring a smooth user experience in real-world mobile applications.  **Algorithm and system co-design** becomes essential to achieve the best possible results.

#### Dynamic Resolution
Dynamic resolution in large language models (LLMs) aims to **optimize processing of high-resolution images** by adapting the resolution to the model's needs, thereby improving efficiency and reducing computational demands.  However, naive implementations can lead to **excessive image enlargement**, resulting in a significant increase in image tokens and consequently, slower processing.  The paper highlights the problem of exaggerated image enlargement in existing methods and proposes a **relaxed aspect ratio matching method**. This improved approach reduces the number of image tokens without sacrificing accuracy by strategically selecting resolutions, preventing unnecessary upscaling and improving deployment efficiency on mobile devices.  **Careful system design**, including batched image encoding and pipeline parallelism, further accelerates the image processing, making real-time performance on mobile phones feasible.  The overall approach emphasizes **algorithm-system co-design**, showing that effective optimization needs to go beyond algorithmic improvements and consider the specific constraints and capabilities of the target hardware.

#### System Optimization
Optimizing system performance for mobile deployment of large multimodal language models (MLLMs) is crucial due to resource constraints.  **Hardware-aware optimization** is key, focusing on efficient utilization of the mobile Neural Processing Unit (NPU).  This involves techniques like **mixed-precision quantization** (INT4/INT8 for weights and INT16/FP16 for activations) to minimize memory footprint and accelerate computation.  **Pipeline parallelism** and **batched processing** of image patches further enhance efficiency during image encoding. Addressing the limitations of NPUs in handling long sequences, techniques like **token downsampling** reduce the number of tokens processed, thereby improving overall speed.  **Careful framework design**, including decoupling image encoding from instruction processing, and implementing **chunked computation** for input tokens, contributes significantly to the overall efficiency. These strategies, when combined, enable real-time performance of complex MLLMs on resource-constrained mobile devices.  **Efficient memory management** is implicitly addressed to prevent memory issues and ensure seamless operation.

#### Benchmark Results
A thorough analysis of benchmark results in a research paper requires a multi-faceted approach.  First, identify the specific benchmarks used; understanding their strengths and limitations is crucial for interpreting the results.  Next, examine the metrics reported; are they appropriate for the task and model type?  **Consider the scale of the benchmarks:** larger, more diverse datasets generally lead to more robust evaluations.  **Analyze the performance relative to baselines and state-of-the-art models**:  how significant is the improvement?  **Statistical significance is key**:  mere performance gains are not enough; results should be backed by statistical testing.  Pay close attention to any error bars or confidence intervals presented to assess the reliability of the findings.  Finally, consider potential biases or limitations: were any specific conditions favorable to a particular model, and does this impact the overall generalizability? A well-written benchmark analysis section will address all of these points, providing a clear, unbiased assessment of the model's performance.

#### Future Work
The paper's 'Future Work' section could explore several promising avenues.  **Extending BlueLM-V-3B's multilingual capabilities** is crucial, given its current strong but not exhaustive performance.  Further research into **optimizing the model for a wider range of mobile devices** with varying processing power and memory is essential to maximize accessibility. Investigating **more sophisticated training techniques** including advanced quantization methods or novel architectures to further enhance efficiency and performance is another important area.  Finally, **exploring different deployment strategies**, such as edge computing or model compression, could significantly improve the real-time response and user experience.  A detailed analysis of potential failure modes and robustness testing would also solidify the model's reliability and pave the way for wider adoption.

> üîº BlueLM-V-3B's architecture is a modified version of the LLaVA approach.  It consists of an image encoder (SigLIP-400M), an MLP projector, and a language model (BlueLM-2.7B). To handle high-resolution images efficiently, a dynamic resolution processing module is included, similar to those used in LLaVA-NeXT and InternVL 1.5.  A token downsampler is added to reduce the number of tokens, which improves efficiency for mobile devices. The diagram shows how images and text are processed and passed to the language model for response generation.

> üîº This figure compares the image processing approaches of three different Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): LLaVA-NeXT, InternVL 1.5, and the authors' proposed BlueLM-V-3B.  It highlights how each model handles high-resolution images. LLaVA-NeXT and InternVL 1.5 both utilize dynamic resolution schemes but tend to significantly enlarge images, leading to a larger number of image tokens after processing by the Vision Transformer (ViT).  LLaVA-NeXT increases the image area by 4 times, while InternVL 1.5 increases it by 25 times.  In contrast, BlueLM-V-3B uses a fixed 1:1 aspect ratio, minimizing image enlargement and resulting in the fewest image tokens. This optimized approach leads to more efficient model training and deployment on mobile devices.

BlueLM-V-3B, in contrast, selects a 1:1 aspect ratio for both resolutions, resulting in the minimum number of image tokens after ViT encoding, which can facilitate both model training and deployment.

The process begins with multiple image patches from a single image, which are encoded in parallel using the Conv2D layer of SigLIP on the CPU.  These intermediate results then feed into the Vision Transformer blocks on the NPU for further parallel processing, significantly shortening the overall inference time.

> üîº The figure illustrates the overall framework of the BlueLM-V-3B deployment.  It highlights a key efficiency improvement: decoupling the image processing (handled by the ViT) from user input processing (text or audio instructions). This allows parallel processing, where image encoding happens concurrently with the handling of user instructions. Once the image encoding is finished, the user instruction is submitted to the LLM for response generation.  For added user-friendliness, the generated text responses can be converted into audio responses in real-time.

The experiment varies the number of image patches processed per batch on the Neural Processing Unit (NPU): 1, 2, 4, and 6. Each batch consists of a global patch and 8 local patches. The results show that processing 4 patches per batch achieves the fastest inference time, indicating an optimal balance between parallelization and computational overhead.

> üîº Figure 8 illustrates the trade-off between latency and throughput when processing various numbers of input tokens concurrently in the BlueLM-V-3B model.  The x-axis represents the number of tokens processed in parallel (t{x}/t1 denotes processing x tokens in parallel), while the y-axis shows both latency (in seconds) and output speed (in tokens per second).  The figure highlights that increasing the number of parallel tokens initially reduces latency and increases throughput, but beyond a certain point, this trend reverses likely due to the limitations of NPU resources.  The output token count remains fixed at one per forward pass, independent of the number of parallel tokens processed, reflecting the autoregressive nature of the LLM. This emphasizes the efficiency optimization achieved in BlueLM-V-3B.
