### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

This research introduces Agent-to-Sim (ATS), a novel method to create realistic simulations of agents (animals, humans) interacting with their environment.  Instead of using expensive, controlled settings and special equipment, ATS uses readily available casual videos recorded over a longer period (e.g., a month).  ATS cleverly tracks the agent and camera movements to create a comprehensive 4D representation (3D space + time).  This data is then used to train a model that generates natural behavior, taking into account the scene and observer interactions. The results showcase successful real-to-sim transfer, creating interactive simulations from the original videos.

> Figure 1: Learning agent behavior from longitudinal casual video recordings. We answer the following question: can we simulate the behavior of an agent, by learning from casually-captured videos of the same agent recorded across a long period of time (e.g., a month)? A) We first reconstruct videos in 4D (3D & time), which includes the scene, the trajectory of the agent, and the trajectory of the observer (i.e., camera held by the observer). Such individual 4D reconstructions are registered across time, resulting in a complete and persistent 4D representation. B) Then we learn a model of the agent for interactive behavior generation. The behavior model explicitly reasons about goals, paths, and full body movements conditioned on the agentâ€™s ego-perception and past trajectory. Such an agent representation allows generation of novel scenarios through conditioning. For example, conditioned on different observer trajectories, the cat agent chooses to walk to the carpet, stays still while quivering his tail, or hide under the tray stand.

> Figure 2: Pipeline for behavior generation. We encode egocentric information into a perception code w, conditioned on which we generate fully body motion in a hierarchical fashion. We start by generating goals Z, then paths P and finally body poses G. Each node is represented by the gradient of its log distribution, trained with denoising objectives (Eq. 8). Given G, the full body motion of an agent can be computed via blend skinning (Eq. 3).

Compared to TotalRecon that does not register multiple videos, ATS produces higher-quality scene reconstruction.

Removing observer conditioning and past trajectory conditioning makes the sampled goals more spread out (e.g., regions both in front of the agent and behind the agent); removing the environment conditioning introduces infeasible goals that penetrate the ground and the walls.

We show novel views rendered with a held-out camera that looks from the opposite side. ATS is able to leverage multiple videos captured at different times to reconstruct the wall (blue box) and the tripod stand (red box) even they are not visible in the input views. Multi-video TotalRecon produces blurry RGB and depth due to bad camera registration. The original TotalRecon takes a single video as input and therefore fails to reconstruct the regions (the tripod and the wall) that are not visible in the input video.
