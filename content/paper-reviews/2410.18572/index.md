### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current long-context language models struggle with the computational cost of processing very long sequences.  This paper introduces Taipan, a new model that blends the efficiency of State Space Models (like Mamba-2) with the power of Transformers' attention mechanisms.  Taipan uses a clever 'selective attention' approach; it only focuses the attention mechanism on the most important parts of the long sequence, ignoring less critical parts to save computing resources. This lets it handle sequences up to a million tokens long while staying computationally efficient.  Experiments show Taipan significantly outperforms other models on tasks needing extensive long-range information retrieval and maintains high efficiency when generating very long texts.
