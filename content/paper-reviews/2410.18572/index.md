### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Taipan is a new language model designed to tackle the challenge of processing very long text sequences.  Current top models, like Transformers, struggle with this because their computational cost grows dramatically as the text gets longer.  Taipan solves this by using a clever combination of two techniques. First, it uses a highly efficient model called Mamba-2 that has constant memory usage, meaning its memory needs don't increase with longer texts.  Second, it adds 'Selective Attention Layers' that carefully focus on the most important words and relationships in the text, ignoring less important parts. This means Taipan is both fast and accurate even on incredibly long texts â€“ up to a million words!  Experiments showed Taipan outperforming other state-of-the-art models, particularly on tasks requiring remembering information from earlier parts of a very long text. This is a significant step forward in the field of long-context language modeling.
