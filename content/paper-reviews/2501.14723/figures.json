We highlight that coverage is continuing to scale with increased inference compute.", "description": "\uadf8\ub9bc 7\uc740 Claude\uc640 DeepSeek-V3 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcd1\ub82c \uc0d8\ud50c \uc218\uc640 \uc21c\ucc28 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ud69f\uc218\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \ub2e4\uc218\uacb0 \ud22c\ud45c \uc810\uc218\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ube44\uad50 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc67c\ucabd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub294 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc0d8\ud50c \uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc21c\ucc28 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ud69f\uc218\ub97c \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \ud588\uc744 \ub54c\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, Claude \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc DeepSeek-V3 \ubaa8\ub378\ub3c4 Claude \ubaa8\ub378 \uc810\uc218\uc758 86.8%\uc5d0 \ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud6e8\uc52c \uc801\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac00\uc6b4\ub370 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub294 DeepSeek-V3 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub2e4\uc218\uacb0 \ud22c\ud45c \uc810\uc218 \ud655\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc790\uc138\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc624\ub978\ucabd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub294 \ubcd1\ub82c \uc0d8\ud50c \uc218\uc640 \uc21c\ucc28 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ud69f\uc218\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 DeepSeek-V3 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd94\ub860 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \ub298\ub9ac\uba74 \uc801\uc6a9 \ubc94\uc704\uac00 \uacc4\uc18d \ud655\uc7a5\ub428\uc744 \uc54c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "section": "2.3 DeepSeek-V3 \uacb0\uacfc"}]
