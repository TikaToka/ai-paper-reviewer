We quantitatively measure the editing performance of our method over competing approaches both in terms of text alignment using CLIP-T [34], and content preservation using CLIP-I [34] and DINO [7] metrics where higher is better for all metrics. We compare our method with both latent diffusion [6, 11], and flow-matching-based approaches [16, 37]. Overall, our method strikes a good balance in terms of alignment with the editing prompt and content preservation. Supplementary to these metrics, we also present a user study as a perceptual evaluation that aligns with our claims regarding edit performance, where our method outperforms the competing approaches.", "description": "\uc774 \ud45c\ub294 FluxSpace\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uad50\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc131\ub2a5 \uce21\uc815\uc740 CLIP-T, CLIP-I, DINO \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc815\ub82c \ubc0f \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \ubcf4\uc874 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\uad50 \ub300\uc0c1\uc5d0\ub294 Latent Diffusion \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95(LEDITS++, TurboEdit)\uacfc Flow-Matching \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95(Sliders-FLUX, RF-Inversion)\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uac01\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec FluxSpace\uac00 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \ub4b7\ubc1b\uce68\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "section": "5.
