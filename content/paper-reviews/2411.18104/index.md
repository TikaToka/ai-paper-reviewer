### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex reasoning tasks, particularly in mathematics, due to a lack of high-quality training data.  Existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, hindering the development of sophisticated mathematical reasoning abilities in AI systems. This creates a significant obstacle for advancing AI's capacity for problem-solving in mathematical domains.

This paper introduces Template-based Data Generation (TDG), a novel method that uses LLMs (specifically GPT-4) to automatically generate meta-templates for creating a vast array of high-quality mathematical problems and their solutions.  The researchers used TDG to generate the TemplateGSM dataset comprising over 7 million problems, which are publicly available.  **This addresses the data scarcity problem and significantly improves the ability to train and evaluate LLMs for mathematical reasoning.**  The method also incorporates a verification process to ensure data accuracy.

> üîº This table presents a statistical overview of the TemplateGSM dataset, which contains synthetically generated grade school math problems.  It details the number of unique templates used to generate the problems, the total count of problems in the dataset, and the ranges and averages of the lengths (measured in tokens) of both the problem statements and their corresponding solutions (in code and natural language formats). The tokenizer used is specified as 'o-200k'. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scale and characteristics, particularly for researchers working with large language models (LLMs) in the context of mathematical problem-solving.
