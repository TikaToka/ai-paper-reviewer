### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large generative models are powerful, but concerns about their reliability and potential misuse are growing.  Current methods to control model outputs often involve computationally expensive fine-tuning which may negatively impact other model aspects. Inference-time interventions are a more desirable approach that avoids retraining the model, but existing methods often rely on simple heuristics. 

This paper introduces Activation Transport (ACT), a general framework for controlling generative models by carefully manipulating their internal activations.  ACT leverages optimal transport theory, a powerful mathematical tool that finds the most efficient way to map one probability distribution to another.  The authors demonstrate ACT's effectiveness and versatility across different model types and tasks, showing significant improvements in various metrics related to safety and control, surpassing several existing methods while preserving model capabilities.

> üîº Table 1 compares several methods for controlling the behavior of large language models (LLMs) at inference time, without retraining.  Most methods involve adding a bias vector to the model's activations.  This bias is often scaled by a parameter (lambda). However, this approach can make the effect of the parameter difficult to interpret, making model control less precise and more sensitive to the choice of layer and model architecture.  AcT (Activation Transport), in contrast, uses optimal transport theory to create an interpolation map between the original and modified activation distributions, offering more fine-grained and interpretable control.

### In-depth insights


#### Activation Transport
The concept of "Activation Transport" presents a novel approach to controlling generative models by manipulating their internal activations.  Instead of retraining or fine-tuning, which can be computationally expensive and potentially disruptive to existing model capabilities, **Activation Transport leverages optimal transport theory** to directly guide activations towards a desired distribution. This offers **fine-grained control** with minimal computational overhead. By viewing model activations as probability distributions, the method maps existing activations onto target distributions, effectively steering model behavior.  The approach is **modality-agnostic**, working effectively across language and image models, showcasing its versatility and broad applicability. **Linear-ACT**, a specific implementation, utilizes a computationally efficient affine transport map, demonstrating effectiveness in various tasks.  This is particularly noteworthy as it's shown to outperform or match previous methods with negligible computational overhead, making it a more practical and scalable solution for controlling large generative models.

#### Optimal Transport Maps
Optimal transport (OT) maps offer a powerful framework for aligning probability distributions. In the context of generative models, OT maps can elegantly steer model activations, effectively controlling the generation process.  **A key advantage of using OT is its ability to preserve the underlying distribution of activations**, preventing out-of-distribution artifacts that can hinder model performance.  By mapping activations from a source distribution (e.g., representing undesirable model outputs) to a target distribution (representing desired outputs), OT can subtly alter the model's behavior without significant computational overhead. This technique is particularly valuable in dealing with high-dimensional data, typical in large language and diffusion models, where traditional methods might struggle.  **The choice of OT cost function significantly impacts the resulting map**, influencing the type and magnitude of changes imposed on the activations.  Furthermore, the computational cost of calculating and applying OT maps remains a challenge, making efficient approximations, like the linear approximations presented in this paper, essential for practical implementation in real-time applications.

#### Linear-ACT Control
Linear-ACT Control, as a proposed method, presents a novel approach to controlling generative models by manipulating their internal activations.  It leverages optimal transport theory for **fine-grained and interpretable control**, offering a significant advantage over prior methods that often rely on heuristic adjustments or lack transparency.  The linearity of the approach ensures **computational efficiency**, making it scalable for large models, while the use of optimal transport ensures the preservation of activation distributions, leading to **robustness and preventing out-of-distribution behaviors.**  The parameter Œª provides an interpretable control knob, allowing users to precisely modulate the strength of the intervention.  This **modality-agnostic** nature extends its application to both language and diffusion models, successfully addressing challenges in toxicity mitigation, concept induction, style control, and concept negation.  **Linear-ACT's effectiveness across diverse tasks and model architectures highlights its potential as a versatile and powerful tool for controlling generative model behavior.**  However, the assumption of linearity may limit its ability to handle complex, multi-modal distributions, representing a key area for future research.

#### Diffusion Model Control
Controlling diffusion models presents a unique challenge due to their intricate generative process.  **Inference-time methods** are particularly attractive as they avoid the computational cost of fine-tuning.  The paper explores the use of optimal transport (OT) to guide the model's activations towards a desired state, offering a **unified framework** for various control mechanisms.  **Linear-ACT**, a computationally efficient instantiation of this framework, demonstrates impressive results in both fine-grained style control and concept negation within image generation.  This approach showcases its adaptability by effectively leveraging the structure of the model's activations to achieve more precise control with minimal overhead. While the paper presents promising findings, further exploration is needed to analyze its limitations and scalability for exceptionally large models.  The core contribution lies in the generalizability of OT for diffusion model control, offering a robust alternative to existing, often less interpretable methods.

#### Future of ACT
The future of Activation Transport (ACT) looks promising, particularly given its demonstrated efficacy and versatility across diverse generative models.  **Further research should explore the application of ACT to even more complex and challenging tasks**, such as controlling the generation of long, coherent narratives in LLMs or generating highly detailed and realistic images with intricate details in diffusion models.  **Expanding ACT to handle multimodal inputs and outputs** would be another important direction, enabling more sophisticated control over content creation that incorporates different modalities of data simultaneously. Investigating the theoretical underpinnings of ACT within the broader context of optimal transport and exploring alternative transport algorithms could lead to further improvements in efficiency and robustness.  **Addressing potential ethical concerns** related to misuse is crucial; robust safety mechanisms and careful consideration of societal impact must accompany future advancements.  Ultimately, the potential of ACT to provide fine-grained, interpretable control over generative models could revolutionize several applications across various domains, from content creation and scientific research to game development and robotics, but this potential must be harnessed responsibly.

> üîº Figure 2 illustrates the effects of different methods for generating transport maps between two distributions.  When the standard deviations of the two distributions are equal (œÉa = œÉb), most methods produce similar maps. However, when the standard deviations differ (œÉa ‚â† œÉb), vector-based methods (like ActAdd, ITI-c, and Mean-AcT) deviate significantly from the optimal map determined by the data samples. This is because vector-based methods rely on simple shifts, whereas the optimal map often requires more complex transformations.  ActAdd exhibits an additional bias stemming from its use of only a single sample pair in its calculations. In contrast, the linear estimator used in the paper shows robustness, producing accurate maps regardless of differences in standard deviation between the distributions.

The pre-prompt is a set of question-answer pairs designed to establish a context for evaluating the model's ability to generate truthful responses.  By using this consistent pre-prompt before each question in the TruthfulQA dataset, the researchers ensure a fair and controlled evaluation of the model's performance on the task of truthfulness.

The x-axis represents the values of Œª, ranging from 1.0 to 15.0 with increments of 1.0. The y-axis shows two key metrics: MC1 Accuracy (reflecting the model's ability to answer truthfully) and MMLU Accuracy (measuring overall model performance). The plot helps determine the optimal Œª value that maximizes truthfulness while maintaining a satisfactory level of overall model performance. The results are based on a single seed (random initialization of the model), suggesting the need for more extensive experiments to confirm the findings.

> üîº This figure shows the results of applying Activation Transport (ACT) and Inference-Time Intervention (ITI-C) methods to control the style of images generated by Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL).  The figure presents a series of images generated using different intervention strengths (lambda). Each row represents a different style (anime, art nouveau, cyberpunk, impressionism, sketch, watercolor), while the columns show the progression from no style intervention (lambda=0) to the strongest intervention. The rightmost column illustrates the results using the optimal intervention strength (lambda=1 for ACT, lambda=2 for ITI-C). The image clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of ACT in inducing a desired style consistently and smoothly, unlike ITI-C, which shows inconsistent and sometimes disruptive results, especially for the cyberpunk style.  The figure provides a visual comparison of how different methods achieve style control in a diffusion model. The original prompt was 'A sandwich is placed next to some vegetables'.

The experiments involved applying several methods (ACT, ITI-C, AURA, ACTADD) to reduce toxicity in model outputs.  For each model, different layers within the model's architecture were targeted for intervention. A parameter Œª (lambda) controls the strength of the intervention. The table shows the best results achieved for each method, focusing on the reduction in toxicity (measured by CLS toxicity) while ensuring that the increase in perplexity (PPL) on a Wikipedia text dataset remained below 1.  The ACT methods consistently yielded the best results, significantly reducing toxicity with minimal impact on perplexity.  In contrast, ITI-C's performance was highly sensitive to the choice of lambda and layer, and AURA's impact was less substantial.

> üîº This table compares the performance of causal and simultaneous estimation methods of Activation Transport (ACT) on the Gemma2-2B language model for toxicity mitigation.  Causal estimation involves sequentially applying transport maps layer by layer, respecting the causal flow of information within the model. Simultaneous estimation, on the other hand, applies transport maps to all layers at once. The table shows various metrics, including perplexity and toxicity scores, to evaluate the effectiveness of each method in reducing toxicity while maintaining the overall model's usability. The results demonstrate that the causal estimation of ACT achieves better results in toxicity reduction compared to simultaneous estimation.

> üîº This table compares the results of causal and simultaneous estimation methods for the Activation Transport (ACT) model on the Llama3-8B large language model.  The goal is toxicity mitigation, as described in section 4.1.  The table shows the performance metrics for both estimation methods across different layers in the model, illustrating that the causal approach leads to better control over toxicity (lower toxicity scores) while maintaining reasonable performance on other metrics. The gray background highlights the causal estimation results.

> üîº This table presents the results of an experiment evaluating the effectiveness of different methods for mitigating toxicity in the Gemma2-2B language model.  The experiment was run five times for each method and layer, and each method's performance was measured based on two metrics: the Classification Loss (CLS) of toxicity and the Perplexity (PPL) on Wikipedia text.  The best result for each method was selected as the one that achieved the lowest CLS toxicity while keeping the increase in PPL to less than 1.  The table shows that the Activation Transport (ACT) methods are robust to the choice of model layers and perform best at lambda = 1, greatly reducing toxicity. In contrast, the Inference-Time Intervention-Contrastive (ITI-C) method is shown to be very sensitive to the choice of model layer and lambda parameter.  The AURA method is also included for comparison, but lacks a controllable strength parameter.

> Table 6: Toxicity mitigation for Gemma2-2B, results over 5 runs. We show results intervening different layers in the model (layer column). ITI-c, ActAdd and AcT have a strength parameter ŒªùúÜ\lambdaitalic_Œª which we sweep, reporting for each method the best result (best ŒªùúÜ\lambdaitalic_Œª) in CLS toxicity that incurs less than +11+1+ 1 increase in PPL Wikipedia. AcT methods are robust to the choice of layer and provide best results for Œª=1ùúÜ1\lambda=1italic_Œª = 1, achieving up to 7.5√ó7.5\times7.5 √ó toxicity mitigation with Linear-AcT. ITI-c is very sensitive to ŒªùúÜ\lambdaitalic_Œª as well as layer choice, and AurA does not provide a strength control.

> üîº This table presents the results of toxicity mitigation experiments conducted on the Llama3-8B language model.  Five runs were performed for each method and layer, and the results show the reduction in toxicity levels while keeping the performance of the model mostly unchanged. The table compares different methods (Linear-ACT, Mean-ACT, ITI-C, ACTADD, AURA), layers in the model (Attention, Post-LN, MLP), and the impact on various metrics such as toxicity (CLS and 0-shot), perplexity, and MMLU accuracy.

> üîº This table presents several text generations from the Gemma2-2B large language model (LLM) using the Activation Transport (ACT) method.  Each row shows a generation with varying strength (Œª) of concept induction for the concept 'Flower'.  The baseline generation (Œª = 0) shows a typical story, whereas increasing Œª values gradually introduce the 'Flower' concept into the narrative, culminating in a story heavily focused on flowers (Œª = 1.0).  The table illustrates the method's ability to precisely control the strength of concept insertion into the generated text.
