He has excellent recall of marine life, which is useful in his research. His goal is to understand the biological clocks (the brain's internal clock) and how they were modified during evolution. He has also worked on physical challenges and video games to learn more about consciousness. His work aims to make the brain accessible to scientists who might not have the same training as neuro-sci professionals.</td><td colspan="2">Precision scores 35.5 42.5</td><td>53.0</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Similarity scores 29.5 26.5</td><td>20.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="5">Gemma 7B (aligned on GPT4o generated 128k dataset) Dr. Eagleman is a thirty-nine-year-old professor of neuroscience known for his innovative research on the brain's biological clocks. Despite a severe nose injury as a child, Eagleman has made a remarkable recovery. His sharp features and interest in 'cool' experiments reflect his personality.</td><td>Precision scores 82.5</td><td>90.5</td><td>74.0</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Similarity scores</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"></td></tr><tr><td>71.7</td><td>82.5</td><td>49.5</td></tr></table>
