This engine is composed of (i) multi-view images with known geometry datasets that obtain ground truth matches by warping pixels using depth maps to other images; (ii) video sequences by leveraging the continuity inherent in video frames to construct point trajectories in a coarse-to-fine manner, and then build training pairs with pseudo ground truth matches between distant frames;\n(iii) image warping that sample transformations to construct synthetic image pairs with perspective changes for large-scale single image datasets.\n(2) Subsequently, cross-modality training pairs are generated to train matching models in learning fundamental image structure and geometric information, which is achieved by using image generation models to obtain pixel-aligned images in other modalities, and then substituted for the original image in the training pairs.", "description": "\uadf8\ub9bc 6\uc740 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uac1c\uc694\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Given a set of consecutive frames Ii,j,k,lsubscriptI\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc59\\textbf{I}_{i,j,k,l}I start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i , italic_j , italic_k , italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, we perform image matching using a state-of-the-art detector-free matcher\u00a0[20] between near frames, which is relatively easy matching task due to the small perspective changes between adjacent frames.\nThe confidence scores associated with each match are visually represented by color shades.\nThese near-frame matches are used to construct point trajectories, which are crucial for establishing matches between distant frames.\nHowever, the detector-free matchers are dependent on each image pair, where applying them to multiple images will lead to inconsistencies, resulting in fragmentary trajectories, as highlighted by the red circle in step (2).\nThe proposed coarse-to-fine framework addresses this problem by first aggregating all matches and their corresponding confidence scores across frames for each image. For instance, in step (2), we demonstrate the aggregated matches for IjsubscriptI\ud835\udc57\\textbf{I}_{j}I start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT.\n(3) Next, we apply a non-maximum suppression process over the frame using a window size of 7\u00d77777\\times 77 \u00d7 7 with matching confidence as a criterion.\nThis process can merge the fragmented matches into a single localization with the highest confidence within their local neighborhood, resulting in continuous trajectories.\nDespite obtaining continuous trajectories, the merging process can reduce their accuracy due to point movements.\nTo correct this, we perform (4) multi-view refinement of the entire trajectory using a transformer-based approach\u00a0[25], achieving precise trajectories.\nThese refined trajectories allow us to establish accurate matches between distant frames IisubscriptI\ud835\udc56\\textbf{I}_{i}I start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and IlsubscriptI\ud835\udc59\\textbf{I}_{l}I start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, which serve as ground truths for training.", "description": "\uc774 \uadf8\ub9bc\uc740 \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 4.2.2\uc808 (Video Sequences)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc2dc\ub41c \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc815\ub2f5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ube44\ud45c\ud604 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6d0\uac70\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784 \uac04\uc758 \ub9e4\uce6d\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\ub4e4 \uac04\uc758 \ub9e4\uce6d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc810 \uc810\uc801 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc6d0\uac70\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784 \uac04\uc758 \ub9e4\uce6d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\uc810\uc740 \uadfc\uc811 \ud504\ub808\uc784 \ub9e4\uce6d\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc810 \uada4\uc801\uc774 \ub2e8\ud3b8\ud654\ub418\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud504\ub808\uc784 \uc804\uccb4\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ub9e4\uce6d \uacb0\uacfc\uc640 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uace0, \ube44\ucd5c\ub300 \uc5b5\uc81c(non-maximum suppression) \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc810 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ud6c4, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubdf0 \uc815\uc81c \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc810 \uada4\uc801\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc5ec \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc815\ub2f5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uadf8\ub9bc\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4\ub85c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uc0c1\uc138 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "section": "4.2.
