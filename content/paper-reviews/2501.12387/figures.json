Our method performs online dense 3D reconstruction from a stream of images (video frames or a photo collection) by using a persistent state. Each input image is encoded into visual tokens via a shared-weight ViT encoder. These tokens interact with state tokens, where state update integrates the current image into the state, and state readout retrieves the past context stored in the state for predictions. Both processes occur simultaneously through two interconnected ViT decoders. Outputs include pointmaps in world and camera frames (only world pointmaps are shown) and the camera-to-world transformation. On the right, we demonstrate our method\u2019s ability to predict unseen views: given a query camera (as a raymap), it reads information from the state to predict its corresponding pointmap, even for unobserved regions. For these readouts, we do not update the state. The hallucinated pointmap is highlighted with a blue border.", "description": "\uc774 \uadf8\ub9bc\uc740 \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860 \uc139\uc158\uc5d0 \uc18d\ud558\uba70, \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc(\ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud504\ub808\uc784 \ub610\ub294 \uc0ac\uc9c4 \ubaa8\uc74c)\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ubc00\uc9d1\ub41c 3D \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc785\ub825 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub294 \uacf5\uc720 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 ViT \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dc\uac01 \ud1a0\ud070\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ub418\uace0, \uc774 \ud1a0\ud070\ub4e4\uc740 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud1a0\ud070\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud310\ub3c5\uc740 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \uc800\uc7a5\ub41c \uacfc\uac70 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uac80\uc0c9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c ViT \ub514\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0\ub294 \uc6d4\ub4dc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uacfc \uce74\uba54\ub77c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc758 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub9f5(\uc6d4\ub4dc \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub9f5\ub9cc \ud45c\uc2dc\ub428)\uacfc \uce74\uba54\ub77c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6d4\ub4dc\ub85c\uc758 \ubcc0\ud658\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc624\ub978\ucabd\uc5d0\ub294 \ucffc\ub9ac \uce74\uba54\ub77c(\ub808\uc774\ub9f5\uc73c\ub85c \ud45c\ud604)\uac00 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba74, \uad00\ucc30\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc601\uc5ed\uc758 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub9f5\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc77d\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud310\ub3c5 \uc2dc\uc5d0\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \ud658\uac01\ub41c \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub9f5\uc740 \ud30c\ub780\uc0c9 \ud14c\ub450\ub9ac\ub85c \uac15\uc870 \ud45c\uc2dc\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "section": "3.
