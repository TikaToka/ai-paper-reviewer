### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Autoregressive models have shown promise in image generation, but they often lag behind diffusion models due to their inherent unidirectional nature which is not ideal for visual data. Existing attempts to improve this by adding bidirectional attention often deviate from the traditional autoregressive paradigm, hindering their integration into unified multimodal models. 

This paper introduces Randomized Autoregressive Modeling (RAR), a simple yet effective technique to enhance the performance of autoregressive image generation models without altering the core framework. **RAR randomly permutes the input sequence during training, encouraging the model to learn from all possible factorization orders**. This process, combined with a randomness annealing strategy, effectively improves bidirectional context modeling, leading to significant gains in image generation quality while maintaining compatibility with language modeling frameworks.  **The results show RAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the ImageNet-256 benchmark.**

### In-depth insights


#### RAR: Bidirectional AR
The research paper section 'RAR: Bidirectional AR' introduces **Randomized Autoregressive Modeling (RAR)**, a novel approach to enhance autoregressive image generation.  RAR addresses the limitations of unidirectional autoregressive models by introducing randomness during training. The input token sequence is randomly permuted with a probability *r*, which **anneals from 1 (fully random) to 0 (raster scan)** over training. This strategy forces the model to learn bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood across all permutation orders.  Importantly, **RAR preserves the autoregressive framework**, ensuring compatibility with language modeling while significantly boosting performance. The effectiveness is demonstrated through improved FID scores on ImageNet-256, surpassing existing autoregressive and diffusion-based methods.  A key element is the introduction of **target-aware positional embeddings**, which guides the model during training with permuted sequences, addressing potential ambiguity in prediction.

#### Annealing Strategy
The research paper introduces a novel **randomness annealing strategy** to enhance autoregressive image generation.  This strategy involves a control parameter, *r*, that governs the probability of using random token order permutations during training. **Initially, *r* is set to 1**, employing entirely random permutations, enabling the model to learn bidirectional relationships between image tokens effectively. As training progresses, *r* linearly decays to 0, transitioning the model to the standard raster scan order. This annealing process is crucial; it starts by maximizing the model's exposure to diverse context arrangements.  The gradual shift to the raster scan helps ensure the model converges on an effective token order, preventing the random permutations from hindering the final model's performance and facilitating compatibility with existing language modeling frameworks.  This **carefully controlled introduction of randomness** ensures the model effectively learns rich bidirectional contexts without compromising overall training stability or generation quality. The results show that this strategy significantly enhances performance, demonstrating the power of controlled randomness in autoregressive visual modeling.

#### Positional Embeddings
The research paper introduces **target-aware positional embeddings** to address limitations of standard positional embeddings within the randomized autoregressive framework.  Standard positional embeddings can fail when identical prediction logits arise from different token permutations, hindering the model's ability to learn from all possible factorization orders.  **Target-aware embeddings** encode information about which token is being predicted next, resolving this ambiguity and ensuring each token prediction has access to the correct context.  This enhancement significantly improves the model's capability to learn bidirectional dependencies from randomly permuted image tokens during the training phase, ultimately boosting the overall image generation performance. The integration of target-aware positional embeddings is a crucial component that enables the successful use of a fully randomized training strategy while maintaining the compatibility of the core autoregressive framework with language models.

#### Ablation Studies
The ablation studies section meticulously investigates the impact of key design choices within the RAR model.  **Randomness Annealing**, a crucial component, is tested with varying start and end epochs for the randomness schedule, revealing its effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation.  **The impact of different scan orders** on final model performance is also analyzed.  Results reveal that while other orders yield reasonable performance, the **standard raster scan order** ultimately delivers superior results, aligning with established practice and providing a beneficial baseline.  These experiments demonstrate the critical roles of the randomness annealing and the chosen scan order in achieving the model's superior image generation quality and offer valuable insights into the design choices affecting this novel autoregressive visual generation model.

#### Future Works
The authors outline several promising avenues for future research.  **Improving the handling of global context during generation** is a primary goal, acknowledging that the current approach, while incorporating bidirectional information, still relies on a sequential generation process.  They suggest exploring techniques like resampling or refinement to enhance context awareness.  **Extending the model's versatility** is another key area, implying work on diverse modalities or tasks beyond image generation, leveraging the model's inherent compatibility with language modeling frameworks.  **Investigating alternative positional embedding strategies** represents a further refinement to enhance the robustness and efficiency of the randomized approach, especially considering the complexity of handling various scan orders.  Finally, **in-depth analysis of the randomness annealing strategy** and exploration of optimal parameter settings are envisioned, with the goal of enhancing training stability and generalization performance.

> üîº Figure 3 illustrates the concept of target-aware positional embeddings within the Randomized Autoregressive (RAR) model.  Panel (a) depicts the training process: images are first tokenized into patches (following the Vision Transformer architecture), each patch receiving an initial positional embedding (blue tokens). The token sequence is then randomly permuted.  Crucially, a *target-aware* positional embedding (green tokens) is added to each token to inform the model which token it should predict next. Panels (b) and (c) showcase the importance of these target-aware embeddings.  Panel (b) shows a failure scenario where, without them, two different permuted sequences produce identical predictions because the original positional embeddings alone aren't sufficient to distinguish the correct prediction in the context of a random permutation. Panel (c) demonstrates that the inclusion of target-aware positional embeddings successfully guides the model toward the correct next-token prediction, even with a randomly permuted input sequence.

> üîº Table 4 presents a comparison of various image generation models on the ImageNet-1K dataset, focusing on 256x256 image generation.  The models are categorized by type (diffusion, masked transformer, autoregressive), tokenizer type (discrete VQ or continuous VAE), and whether rejection sampling was used.  Results are evaluated using the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) metric, with additional metrics provided in some cases.  Note that some models generate images at a resolution of 384x384 and then resize to 256x256 for consistent evaluation.

> üîº This table compares the speed of generating images (samples/second) using different image generation models on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.  The models are grouped based on their Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) scores, a metric indicating image quality, to ensure a fair comparison.  The throughput is measured using float32 precision and a batch size of 128, following the original codebases of each method. Notably, the models using autoregressive architectures (RAR and VAR) utilize KV-cache optimization for efficiency, resulting in higher speeds.  'Diff.' indicates diffusion models and 'Mask.' represents masked transformer models. The table highlights how the proposed RAR method is not only efficient in generating images but also significantly faster than many other methods with comparable FID scores.
