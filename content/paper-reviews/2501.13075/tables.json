Types of Risk and Uncertainty. Optimization is most straightforward in deterministic settings with complete information, and more challenging in situations of risk, where there are unknowns, but their parameters are known or estimable. More challenging still are situations where there exist unknown unknowns, i.e.\u00a0future possibilities that are qualitatively novel and difficult or impossible to anticipate (though they may seem obvious in hindsight) \u2013 the central topic of this paper. The fourth quadrant of unknown knowns (e.g.\u00a0where an agent or system has implicit knowledge that is not explicitly known) is also important but less relevant to arguments here. In short, machine learning excels at situations of determinism or risk, but struggles to model Knightian uncertainty.", "description": "\ud45c 1\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc758 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc720\ud615(\uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801, \uc704\ud5d8, \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd, \ub098\uc774\ud2b8 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131)\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \uac00\uc7a5 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\uac70\ub098 \ucd94\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubbf8\uc9c0\uc218\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub354 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubbf8\ub798 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\uac70\ub098 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \ubbf8\uc9c0\uc218\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669(\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec \uc8fc\uc81c)\uc740 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd(\uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc54c\ub824\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub610\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0)\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uacfc\ub294 \uad00\ub828\uc131\uc774 \ub0ae\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac04\ub2e8\ud788 \ub9d0\ud574 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uc0c1\ud669\uc774\ub098 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub098\uc774\ud2b8 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub370\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "section": "2.1 \ub098\uc774\ud2b8 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131"}]
