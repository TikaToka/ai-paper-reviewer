### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Traditional embodied AI agents rely heavily on physical exploration to update their understanding of the world, which can be costly, time-consuming, and unsafe.  Humans, however, often use mental imagery to imagine unseen parts of the world, allowing for more informed decisions without physical exploration. This paper addresses these issues.

The paper introduces Generative World Explorer (Genex), a novel framework that allows agents to imaginatively explore 3D environments. Genex uses a video generation model to create imagined observations, which are then used to update the agent's belief and inform its decision-making process.  The experimental results demonstrate Genex's ability to generate high-quality and consistent imagined observations, leading to better decisions. Furthermore, a new benchmark dataset, Genex-EQA, is introduced to facilitate future research in this area.

> üîº The Generative World Explorer (Genex) framework enables an agent to perform mental exploration of a large-scale 3D environment.  Instead of physically exploring, the agent uses Genex to imaginatively explore from different perspectives. The figure illustrates this with an example: Agent 1 (a silver car) is approaching an intersection.  It uses Genex to simulate the view from Agent 2's perspective (a taxi that has stopped unexpectedly). Through this simulated perspective, Agent 1 discovers an ambulance that is blocking Agent 2's view. This new information (the ambulance) modifies Agent 1's belief about the situation and thus allows it to make a more informed decision (e.g. clearing the way for the ambulance instead of simply proceeding through the intersection). This highlights Genex's ability to improve decision-making by enabling belief revision through imaginative exploration.

In this example, agent 1 (sliver car) imaginatively explores to the perspective at the location of agent 2 (taxi) with Genex. The imagined observation at agent 2‚Äôs position (including the explored ambulance) revises agent 1‚Äôs belief and enables more informed decision making.

### In-depth insights


#### Imaginative Exploration
The concept of "Imaginative Exploration" in the context of embodied AI signifies a significant departure from traditional methods.  Instead of solely relying on physical exploration to update an agent's understanding of its environment, **imaginative exploration allows the agent to mentally simulate different scenarios and gather information from these imagined experiences.** This approach is particularly valuable in scenarios where physical exploration is dangerous, time-consuming, or simply impossible. By leveraging generative models, agents can create virtual simulations, allowing them to explore potential outcomes without risking real-world consequences. **The key innovation lies in the use of generative models to produce realistic and consistent imagined observations that can update the agent's belief state.** This updated belief, enriched by imagined experiences, enables more informed decision-making and improved planning.  The potential applications are vast, spanning robotics, autonomous driving, and even human-computer interaction, where the ability to envision future states empowers more efficient and effective actions. The success of imaginative exploration hinges on the generative model's capacity to produce high-quality and consistent imagined sensory inputs, accurately reflecting the dynamics of the simulated environment.  **Further research should focus on refining the fidelity and robustness of the generative models**, as well as integrating the imagined experiences seamlessly with real-world observations to create a more comprehensive and accurate representation of the environment.

#### Genex Framework
The Genex framework presents a novel approach to embodied AI, enabling agents to perform imaginative exploration within large-scale 3D environments.  **Instead of relying solely on physical exploration**, Genex leverages a video generation model to create imagined observations, effectively updating the agent's belief about the world. This process allows for more informed decision-making, even in scenarios where physical exploration is costly or impossible. The framework's core innovation lies in its use of panoramic egocentric views and spherical-consistent learning, ensuring the generation of high-quality and consistent imagined videos.  **This imaginative exploration complements traditional POMDP frameworks**, leading to improved belief revision and decision-making capabilities.  Genex is not limited to single-agent scenarios; its ability to model beliefs of other agents further enhances its potential for application in complex, multi-agent environments.  **The system's integration of generative video with LLM decision-making is also significant**, bridging the gap between visual perception and high-level reasoning.  Overall, Genex offers a promising direction for advancing embodied AI, potentially unlocking more human-like cognitive abilities in artificial agents.

#### Belief Revision
Belief revision, in the context of embodied AI, signifies the process of updating an agent's internal model of the world based on new information.  **This is crucial for agents operating in partially observable environments**, where they lack complete knowledge of their surroundings.  Traditional approaches often rely on physical exploration to gather this information, but humans effectively use imagination to revise their beliefs without direct physical interaction. The paper's focus is on enabling agents to perform this imaginative belief revision using generative models. **Generative models allow the agent to 'imagine' possible unseen scenarios**, generating synthetic observations that update their internal belief.  This imagined exploration is computationally cheaper and safer than physical exploration. The effectiveness of this approach hinges on the quality and consistency of generated observations. The paper introduces techniques to improve this quality, thereby improving decision-making based on more accurate belief states.  **The concept of imagination-driven belief revision represents a significant advancement**, bridging the gap between purely reactive AI agents and those with more proactive, human-like cognitive abilities. This enables better planning and decision-making in complex, dynamic environments.

#### Embodied Decision
Embodied decision-making, as explored in the context of this research, signifies a significant departure from traditional AI approaches.  Instead of relying solely on abstract representations and symbolic reasoning, embodied decision-making emphasizes the importance of **physical interaction with the environment**. This involves integrating sensorimotor experiences, internal models of the world, and the agent's own physical constraints into the decision-making process.  A key aspect is the challenge of partial observability: agents often lack complete information about their surroundings, necessitating the use of **belief updating mechanisms** based on sensory input and exploration. The paper proposes innovative methods such as generative world models and imaginative exploration to enhance decision-making capabilities in partially observable environments.  The integration of **large language models (LLMs)** further enables more sophisticated reasoning and planning, bridging the gap between perception, cognition, and action. This integrated approach yields more informed, robust, and context-aware decisions, particularly when dealing with complex and dynamic situations.  **Multi-agent scenarios** represent an exciting extension of this framework, requiring agents to understand and predict each others' behavior, resulting in collaborative and strategic decision-making.

#### 3D World Modeling
3D world modeling is crucial for embodied AI agents to navigate and interact with complex environments.  A core challenge is creating accurate and efficient representations that balance detail with computational feasibility.  **Techniques like voxel grids and point clouds offer different trade-offs**; voxel grids provide a regularized structure, enabling easier reasoning but potentially suffering from high memory usage for detailed environments. Point clouds, while more efficient, lack inherent spatial structure.  **Generative models show promise**, but their output quality and consistency need to be rigorously evaluated, especially over long time horizons and for varied scene complexity.  **Combining generative methods with other techniques**, like depth sensing or multi-view geometry, could create robust hybrid approaches that offer the best of both worlds.  Furthermore, **incorporation of semantic information** into 3D models, such as object labels and relationships, would greatly enhance agent capabilities by improving understanding and decision-making. Finally, the ability to **efficiently handle partial observations** is critical, necessitating techniques to model uncertainty and handle incomplete world states.  Future work must consider these factors when developing 3D world modeling approaches for advanced embodied AI agents.

> üîº Figure 2 illustrates the Generative World Explorer (Genex) framework. Panel (a) shows the overall architecture: Genex takes as input an RGB observation (a panoramic image), an exploration direction, and a distance.  It then generates a sequence of imagined video frames, simulating the agent's movement and allowing exploration of unseen parts of the environment.  Panel (b) demonstrates Genex performing goal-agnostic exploration, where the agent freely explores its surroundings to build a better understanding. This is guided by a large language model (LLM) providing high-level instructions. Panel (c) shows Genex executing goal-driven exploration, where the agent receives a specific goal (e.g., 'Move to the blue car's position') and uses the LLM to plan and execute a series of actions to achieve it, again generating imagined video along the way.

> üîº Figure 3 illustrates the architecture of the Genex video diffusion model.  Panel (a) shows the model's training process.  A video (x‚ÇÄ) is encoded into a latent representation (z‚ÇÄ).  Noise is then added to this latent representation (resulting in z‚Çú). A conditional U-Net (œµŒ∏) attempts to reverse this process by predicting and removing the added noise. The output of the U-Net (z‚ÇÄ‚Ä≤) is then decoded back into a video (x‚ÇÄ‚Ä≤). The training objective is to minimize the difference between the original video (x‚ÇÄ) and the reconstructed video (x‚ÇÄ‚Ä≤).
