### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with effectively unifying video comprehension and generation.  Existing methods often rely on discrete video tokenization, limiting performance. The complex nature of video data, incorporating both spatial and temporal dynamics, poses a significant challenge.

The researchers propose "Divot," a diffusion-powered video tokenizer.  **Divot leverages the diffusion process for self-supervised learning of video representations, overcoming the limitations of discrete tokenization.**  By using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to represent the continuous video features, Divot-LLM,  integrated with a pre-trained LLM, achieves strong performance on various benchmarks, demonstrating effective video comprehension and generation capabilities.

> üîº This figure illustrates the Divot framework, which uses a diffusion model for self-supervised video representation learning.  The process begins with a video tokenizer that extracts spatiotemporal features from a video. These features act as conditioning information for a diffusion model, which is trained to remove noise from corrupted video clips.  Crucially, because the diffusion model learns to reconstruct the video from noisy input conditioned on the tokenizer's features, the tokenizer is implicitly learning robust and effective representations of the video. Moreover, the diffusion model itself also acts as a de-tokenizer, enabling the generation of realistic video clips from the learned video representations. This dual functionality of the diffusion model allows for unified video comprehension and generation within a single framework.

### In-depth insights


#### Diffusion Video Tokens
The concept of "Diffusion Video Tokens" represents a significant advancement in video representation learning.  It leverages the power of diffusion models to create tokens that **capture both spatial and temporal information** within video data, unlike traditional methods which often struggle to adequately model temporal dynamics.  This approach offers several key benefits.  First, the self-supervised nature of diffusion models allows for learning robust representations directly from unlabeled video data, reducing reliance on expensive manual annotations.  Second, the **continuous nature** of these tokens potentially enables more nuanced and expressive representations compared to discrete methods, leading to improved performance in both comprehension and generation tasks.   **The duality of the diffusion process ‚Äì acting as both a tokenizer and de-tokenizer ‚Äì is a crucial advantage**. It allows for seamless translation between video and its tokenized representation and enables efficient video generation from text or other prompts.

#### Divot-LLM: Model
Divot-LLM represents a novel approach to unifying video comprehension and generation within a Large Language Model (LLM) framework.  **Its core innovation is the Divot tokenizer**, a diffusion-powered system that learns video representations in a self-supervised manner. This tokenizer effectively captures both the spatial and temporal dynamics of videos, addressing a key challenge in prior video-LLM architectures. Unlike discrete tokenizers, Divot utilizes a continuous representation, better suited for nuanced video understanding.  The model leverages a pre-trained video diffusion model, acting as both a tokenizer and de-tokenizer, thus facilitating seamless video-to-text and text-to-video transformations. Divot-LLM integrates this tokenizer with a pre-trained LLM, enabling video comprehension via video-to-text autoregression. For video generation, **Divot-LLM innovatively models the continuous Divot features using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**, avoiding the limitations of simpler regression approaches. This probabilistic modeling enables more diverse and realistic video generation. The combination of a powerful, continuous video tokenizer and a probabilistic generation mechanism makes Divot-LLM a significant advancement in multimodal video understanding and creation.

#### GMM for Video Gen
The section 'GMM for Video Gen' likely details the application of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for generating videos.  Instead of directly regressing to video features from an LLM, **GMMs provide a probabilistic framework**. This allows the model to capture the inherent variability and complexity within video data, leading to more realistic and less deterministic video generation.  The approach likely involves training the LLM to predict the parameters (means, variances, and mixture probabilities) of a GMM that models the distribution of continuous video representations from a video tokenizer.  During inference, sampling from this learned GMM provides the input for a video decoder, potentially a diffusion model, to generate novel video sequences.  This probabilistic method addresses the limitations of deterministic regression that produces overly averaged or repetitive outputs, leading to more diverse and natural-looking video generations. **The key advantage is the ability to generate diverse videos from a single text prompt**, showcasing the power of GMMs in handling the high dimensionality and complex temporal dynamics present in video data. This approach moves beyond simpler methods and tackles the complex problem of high-quality video synthesis.

#### Ablation Study
An ablation study systematically removes components of a model to determine their individual contributions.  In the context of a video tokenizer, this might involve testing variations of the model architecture, such as removing the spatial-temporal transformer or the Perceiver Resampler.  **The impact on both video comprehension and generation tasks would be carefully measured** to gauge the importance of each component. Results could reveal that, for instance, the spatial-temporal transformer is critical for capturing temporal dynamics, while the Perceiver Resampler is essential for efficient LLM integration.  **Such insights would guide future model improvements and help understand the strengths and weaknesses of each module.** Furthermore, an ablation study might investigate alternative loss functions or training procedures, for example, replacing the GMM with a simpler MSE regression or using a different diffusion model. By comparing results across these variations, **researchers can gain a deep understanding of the design choices** that impact performance and identify promising areas for optimization.  Ultimately, the findings would highlight the robustness and efficiency of the overall approach.

#### Future Work
Future work for the Divot model could involve several key areas. **Extending the model's capabilities to longer videos** is crucial, as the current model is limited to short clips.  Improving the quality and diversity of generated videos is also important, potentially by exploring advanced diffusion models or incorporating more diverse training data.  **Investigating the use of more powerful LLMs** could significantly enhance Divot-LLM's performance across comprehension and generation tasks.  **Exploring different architectures for the video tokenizer**, beyond the current ViT-based approach, may lead to more efficient and effective representations. Finally, more rigorous benchmarking against a wider range of tasks and datasets, including those focusing on more nuanced aspects of video understanding such as action recognition and temporal reasoning, would further validate the robustness of the model.

> üîº Figure 2 illustrates the Divot model's tokenization and de-tokenization processes.  During training, the model takes sparsely sampled video frames as input to its tokenizer. This tokenizer generates spatiotemporal representations of the video. These representations are then used to condition a U-Net, a type of neural network, which is trained using a self-supervised approach. The U-Net's task is to remove noise from noisy representations (VAE latents) of densely sampled video frames. The success of the U-Net in denoising is directly tied to how well the tokenizer captures relevant information from the video.  In essence, the training process teaches the tokenizer to create effective representations by training the network to reconstruct a high-quality version of the original video based on those representations.  Critically, the same U-Net then also functions as a de-tokenizer. During inference (when using the model after training), the tokenizer produces video representations that are passed to the de-tokenizer (which is the same U-Net) to generate realistic video clips.
