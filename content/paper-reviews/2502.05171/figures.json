Following a precedent of training recurrent architectures for algorithmic and arithmetic tasks (Schwarzschild et\u00a0al., 2021b; Bansal et\u00a0al., 2022; Schwarzschild et\u00a0al., 2023; McLeish et\u00a0al., 2024), we explore whether our model can leverage increased test-time compute via recurrence to solve verbalized addition problems of increased difficulty. For these problems we use the following system prompt \u2018\u2018You are a helpful assistant that is capable of helping users with mathematical reasoning.\u2019\u2019 embedded in a conversational chat template, and we present each problem by opening the first user turn of the conversation like so: f\"What is the result of \u2019 + \u2019.join(map(str, digits))?\" after randomly sampling numbers according to a certain operand count and digit count (base 10). We score correct answers by checking whether the correct sum appears as as string anywhere in the model\u2019s output, and for each measurement, we average over 50 trials. \n\nIn the heatmap (top left), we evaluate the model at 32 recurrences to get a upper estimate of its addition performance at various difficulties. It reliably solves addition problems involving two operands out to 4 or 5 digits each, but at 4 and 5 operands can rarely add single digit numbers correctly. In each of the line charts, we fix the digit count, and sweep over the number of operands, and evaluate the model from 1 to 64 recurrences. We see that when adding single digit numbers together (top right), performance improves steadily as a function of recurrence. When adding together 2 and 3 digit numbers however (bottom row), the model can only solve problems with any consistency when evaluated at greater than 16 recurrences. Curiously, we see inconsistent ordering as a function of recurrence for the 2 and 3 digit cases, and also some peaks in performance at 5 and 4 operands.
