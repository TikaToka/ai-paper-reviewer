The BoxingGym\u00a0Framework is designed to holistically evaluate experimental design and model discovery capabilities in the spirit of George Box [6]. 1) The process starts with a user defining a goal for the scientist agent. 2) The scientist formulates a theory. 3) This theory guides the experimental design, where the scientist interacts with a simulated world to gather new data. 4) The scientist then analyzes the new and old data to propose and refine theories. This iterative process continues for several iterations. 5) The scientist is then asked to explain the findings to a novice. 6) We evaluate the novice and the scientist by casting the goal as a prediction problem.", "description": "BoxingGym \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uace0\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub294 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0 \uae30\uc874 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uac70\uce5c \ud6c4, \uacfc\ud559\uc790 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ucd08\ubcf4\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0, \ubaa9\ud45c \ub2ec\uc131 \uc5ec\ubd80\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc774\ub860, \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc124\uacc4, \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacfc\ud559\uc790\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.01540/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Python pseudocode examples.
