Can you give me your reason?<br>LMM: The name of this leaf disease is **Bell Pepper Leaf with Bacterial Spot Disease**. The reason for this name is that the leaf has _brown or black necrotic spots_, which are characteristic of bacterial infections. These spots can coalesce, forming _larger necrotic areas_, and the leaf may exhibit _chlorosis or yellowing_ of surrounding leaf tissue. The spots are often located on _the underside of the leaf_, and the leaf may become _crinkled or deformed_ near affected areas. |\n| https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14044/extracted/6217851/Figures/case_2.jpg | User: OK then, what chemical should I use to treat this disease?<br>LMM: It is recommended to use a **copper-based fungicide** to treat this disease.<br>User: Identify this bird.

The presence of _a crest on its head_ and a _black \u201dmask\u201d around its eyes_ further supports the identification of this bird.<br>User: Where can I find this bird?<br>LMM: You can find this bird in **the United States**, specifically in the **eastern and central parts** of the country.
