At each SDS step, we select a viewpoint and render both the input object and the 4D NeRF from the same selected viewpoint. These renders, along with the textual prompts, are then fed into the image-to-video model, and the SDS loss is calculated to guide the generation of motion while preserving the object\u2019s identity.\nThe attention-masked SDS, focuses learning on the relevant parts of the object, improving identity preservation.", "description": "\uadf8\ub9bc 2\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c 3to4D \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc815\uc801 \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc801 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ubaa8\ub450 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 4D \ubc29\uc0ac\uc728 \ud544\ub4dc\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800, \uac01 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc785\ub825 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uac16\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \uac1d\uccb4(\uc67c\ucabd\uc758 \uc2dd\ubb3c)\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 4D NeRF\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c, \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0-\ube44\ub514\uc624 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec 4D NeRF\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 SDS \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc2dc\uc810\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uace0 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc2dc\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc785\ub825 \uac1d\uccb4\uc640 4D NeRF\ub97c \ubaa8\ub450 \ub80c\ub354\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub80c\ub354\ub9c1\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0-\ube44\ub514\uc624 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc785\ub825\ub418\uace0, SDS \uc190\uc2e4\uc774 \uacc4\uc0b0\ub418\uc5b4 \uac1d\uccb4\uc758 \uc815\uccb4\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub3d9\uc791 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5b4\ud150\uc158 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\uac00 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c SDS\ub294 \uac1d\uccb4\uc758 \uad00\ub828 \ubd80\ubd84\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\uccb4\uc131 \ubcf4\uc874\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "section": "3.
