### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current training-free approaches for spatially grounding text-to-image models often struggle with accurate object placement within bounding boxes. They typically rely on noisy image updates via backpropagation from custom loss functions, resulting in imprecise control.  This limits the flexibility and precision of user-guided image generation.



This paper introduces GROUNDIT, a novel training-free technique that utilizes the flexibility of Diffusion Transformers. GROUNDIT employs a two-stage approach: global update for initial refinement and local update for fine-grained control. The core innovation is a **noisy patch transplantation mechanism** which cultivates and transplants denoised patches into designated bounding box regions. This approach enables robust spatial grounding, achieving **state-of-the-art performance** on benchmark datasets, particularly when handling complex scenarios with multiple or small bounding boxes.

Denoising two noisy images using joint token denoising results in semantically correlated content between the generated images. Here, y indicates that joint token denoising is during the initial 100% of the timesteps, after which the images are denoised for the remaining steps.
