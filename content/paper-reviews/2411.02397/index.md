### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Generating high-fidelity videos, especially long ones, is computationally expensive.  Recent advancements in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have improved video quality but increased the computational burden. This necessitates faster inference methods without sacrificing video quality.  Existing solutions often involve retraining models or require significant architecture changes, limiting their wide adoption.

AdaCache, a training-free method, accelerates video DiTs by adaptively caching computations based on video content. It introduces a caching schedule tailored to each video, and Motion Regularization, controlling computation allocation based on motion content.  AdaCache showed significant speedups (up to 4.7x) in experiments across several DiT baselines, without affecting video quality.  This plug-and-play approach makes AdaCache easily adaptable to existing models and represents a significant advancement in efficient video generation.

> üîº Table 1 presents a quantitative comparison of AdaCache against other training-free methods for accelerating video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs).  Multiple video DiT baselines are evaluated: Open-Sora (480p, 2-second videos, 30 denoising steps), Open-Sora-Plan (512x512, 2.7-second videos, 150 steps), and Latte (512x512, 2-second videos, 50 steps).  Generation quality is assessed using VBench, PSNR, LPIPS, and SSIM.  Computational complexity is evaluated using FLOPs, latency (measured on a single A100 GPU), and speedup.  The results show that AdaCache-fast achieves the best speedups with comparable or slightly lower quality compared to other methods.  AdaCache-slow provides the best quality while remaining faster than the alternatives.  Finally, the inclusion of motion regularization in AdaCache consistently improves quality with minimal latency increase.

### In-depth insights


#### AdaCache: Core Idea
AdaCache's core idea centers on **accelerating video diffusion transformers** without retraining by leveraging the fact that not all videos demand the same computational resources.  It does so by **selectively caching residual computations** within transformer blocks during the diffusion process.  A key innovation is the **content-dependent caching schedule**, which dynamically decides when to recompute based on a distance metric measuring the rate of change between stored and current representations.  This adaptive strategy, coupled with **Motion Regularization** (MoReg) that prioritizes computations for high-motion content, maximizes the quality-latency trade-off, resulting in significant speedups without compromising video quality.  Essentially, AdaCache intelligently allocates computational resources based on the complexity of each video sequence, optimizing performance across a wide range of video generation tasks.

#### MoReg: Motion Focus
The research paper introduces Motion Regularization (MoReg) to enhance Adaptive Caching, addressing the challenge that video generation quality significantly depends on motion content.  **MoReg leverages a noisy latent motion score, calculated from residual frame differences to dynamically adjust the caching strategy.**  Instead of a fixed schedule, computations are allocated proportionally to motion content, **caching less and recomputing more frequently for high-motion videos to prevent inconsistencies.** This content-aware approach helps avoid issues like artifacts or color inaccuracies often seen in high-speed video generations, maximizing the quality-latency tradeoff. MoReg proves particularly beneficial in high-motion content videos, granting substantial gains in generation quality without sacrificing significant speed.

#### Empirical Validation

#### Multi-GPU Speedups
The research explores the impact of AdaCache on multi-GPU setups, aiming for significant speedups in video generation.  **AdaCache consistently demonstrates superior acceleration compared to the baseline and a prior method (PAB)** across various GPU configurations (1, 2, 4, and 8 GPUs).  The speed improvements are more pronounced with a higher number of GPUs, suggesting that AdaCache effectively mitigates the communication overhead typically associated with multi-GPU parallelism.  This is achieved by reducing redundant computations through the caching mechanism, enabling better scaling efficiency.  The results showcase **a notable quality-latency trade-off**, highlighting AdaCache's potential for high-performance video generation in resource-rich environments.

> üîº This figure demonstrates the varying complexity of videos and how this impacts the efficiency of video generation. The left panel shows that reducing the number of diffusion steps during video generation affects different videos differently. Some videos maintain good quality even with fewer steps (robust), while others degrade significantly (fragile).  The right panel visualizes the differences in computed representations (features) between consecutive steps in the diffusion process. The significant variability across videos suggests that a fixed computational schedule is inefficient. This observation motivates the use of a content-adaptive method, Adaptive Caching, to optimize the denoising process by tailoring it to the complexity of each individual video.

Some sequences are extremely robust (e.g. first-two columns), while others break easily. (Right) When we plot the difference between computed representations in subsequent diffusion steps, we see unique variations (Feature distance vs.¬†#steps). If we are to reuse similar representations, it needs to be tailored to each video.

The results reveal a substantial variation in the final video quality across these different configurations, highlighting the importance of efficient resource allocation to achieve high-quality video generation.

> üîº Figure 4 illustrates Adaptive Caching, a method for accelerating video generation using Diffusion Transformers (DiTs).  The left panel shows the caching process.  Residual computations within the DiT's blocks are selectively cached based on a content-dependent schedule.  This schedule is determined by a metric (c<sub>t</sub>) that quantifies the change between the current and previously computed representations.  A larger c<sub>t</sub> indicates a greater change, leading to less caching and more recomputation.  The right panel details the caching strategy within a DiT block, showing only the residuals (skip-connections) are cached and reused. The main video representation (f<sub>t+k</sub>, f<sub>t</sub>) is always updated with either a newly computed or a cached residual.

> Figure 4: Overview of Adaptive Caching: (Left) During the diffusion process, we choose to cache residual computations within selected DiT blocks. The caching schedule is content-dependent, as we decide when to compute the next representation based on a distance metric (ctsubscriptùëêùë°c_{t}italic_c start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT). This metric measures the rate-of-change from previously-computed (and, stored) representation to the current one, and can be evaluated per-layer or the DiT as-a-whole. Each computed residual can be cached and reused across multiple steps. (Right) We only cache the residuals (i.e., skip-connections) which amount to the actual computations (e.g. spatial-temporal/cross attention, MLP). The iteratively denoised representation (i.e., ft+ksubscriptùëìùë°ùëòf_{t+k}italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t + italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, ftsubscriptùëìùë°f_{t}italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) always gets updated either with computed or cached residuals.
