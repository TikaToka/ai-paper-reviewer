### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with complex reasoning tasks, especially when using the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting method. This is primarily due to distribution shifts between training and inference, leading to decreased performance in generating detailed reasoning steps.  Many existing multimodal preference datasets focus on addressing hallucination rather than improving reasoning abilities, and lack data representative of scientific images and reasoning tasks.  These limitations hinder the development of more capable MLLMs. 

To address these issues, the researchers introduced Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO), a novel method that combines supervised fine-tuning with preference optimization losses.  **MPO effectively enhances the model's ability to generate high-quality reasoning steps.**  They also created a large-scale, high-quality multimodal reasoning preference dataset called MMPR, using an automated pipeline to efficiently generate preference pairs.  **The resulting InternVL2-8B-MPO model significantly outperforms previous open-source models on various multimodal reasoning benchmarks, achieving performance comparable to much larger models.** This work demonstrates the effectiveness of preference optimization in improving MLLM reasoning abilities, providing valuable resources for future research in the field.

### In-depth insights


#### MMReasoning Enhancements
MMReasoning Enhancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent a crucial area of ongoing research.  **Improving the reasoning capabilities** of these models is vital for their broader applicability and real-world impact.  The core challenge lies in bridging the gap between the model's ability to process and understand multimodal data (text, images, etc.) and its capacity to perform complex reasoning tasks that involve integrating information from multiple modalities.  **Techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** prompting have shown promise, yet MLLMs still struggle with distribution shifts and suffer performance drops when employing CoT.  **Preference Optimization (PO)** emerges as a powerful technique to address these shortcomings by aligning model outputs with desired reasoning patterns, using preference signals rather than explicit reward models. **Datasets like MMPR** become critical for training these models, enabling them to learn from a large corpus of high-quality, multimodal reasoning preferences.  The overall goal is to develop methods capable of improving performance not only on benchmark tasks, but also for addressing the problem of hallucinations and generally enhancing the quality of reasoning in real-world applications.

#### MPO: A Novel Approach
The proposed Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO) presents a novel approach to enhance multimodal reasoning in large language models (LLMs).  **MPO cleverly combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with preference optimization losses**, addressing the limitations of existing methods.  This blend allows the model to learn not only the relative preference between different responses but also their absolute quality and the generation process of preferred responses.  The use of DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) and BCO (Binary Classifier Optimization) as components within the MPO framework demonstrates a focus on computational efficiency and stability.  By incorporating various Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches, **MPO aims to improve reasoning effectiveness and reduce hallucinations.** The comprehensive evaluation of MPO on diverse benchmarks supports its efficacy, particularly in multimodal reasoning tasks.  **The creation of MMPR, a large-scale, high-quality multimodal reasoning preference dataset, directly supports MPO's training**, providing significant improvements over models trained solely on SFT.  This synergistic approach between data construction and a novel optimization technique showcases a thoughtful strategy to advance the capabilities of MLLMs.

#### MMPR Dataset Creation
The creation of the MMPR dataset is a crucial aspect of this research, focusing on generating high-quality multimodal reasoning preference data.  **The process cleverly addresses the scarcity of such data** by employing two main pipelines: a correctness-based pipeline for samples with clear ground truth and a DropoutNTP pipeline for samples without.  The correctness-based pipeline leverages existing datasets with readily available answers to efficiently create positive and negative samples.  **DropoutNTP, a more innovative approach,** uses a clever truncation and prediction method to generate preference pairs, reducing the reliance on ground truth and thus making the data generation process more scalable. The pipeline is designed to reduce costs while ensuring sufficient quality.  **MMPR's data diversity is ensured by incorporating samples from diverse domains,** such as general visual question answering, science, charts, mathematics, OCR, and documents. This multifaceted approach helps build a robust dataset that avoids bias and improves the generalizability and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs trained on it. **This systematic and efficient approach to dataset creation serves as a significant contribution**, facilitating future research on multimodal reasoning and preference optimization within the field of large language models.

#### Ablation Study Analysis
An ablation study systematically removes components of a model or process to assess their individual contributions.  In the context of a research paper, an 'Ablation Study Analysis' section would dissect the impact of specific design choices. For example, it could explore variations in the preference optimization techniques, such as comparing direct preference optimization (DPO) with other algorithms.  It might also analyze different chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategies or the impact of data set size and source diversity.  **A key insight would be the relative importance of each component**. The analysis should not only report performance metrics but also offer explanations for observed trends.  **Strong ablation studies provide crucial evidence for the validity and robustness of the proposed model**.  They reveal **which parts are essential and which are less critical**, guiding future research and refinement.  Furthermore, a robust analysis would consider the computational costs associated with different approaches and discuss the trade-offs between complexity and performance.  In short, a well-executed and thoughtful ablation study clarifies the model's inner workings and justifies its overall design. The goal is to demonstrate that the improvements are attributable to specific design choices rather than spurious effects.

#### Future Research Needs
Future research should prioritize improving the efficiency and scalability of multimodal preference optimization.  **Developing more sophisticated methods for automatically generating high-quality preference data** is crucial, reducing reliance on expensive and time-consuming manual annotation.  Further exploration of different preference optimization algorithms and their relative strengths and weaknesses across various multimodal tasks is needed.  **Investigating the interplay between preference optimization and other training paradigms**, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, is essential.  Additionally, **research should focus on enhancing the robustness and generalizability of MLLMs** trained with preference optimization, making them less susceptible to distribution shifts and more adaptable to diverse downstream applications.  Finally, **a deeper understanding of the limitations of current approaches** and potential biases in preference data is necessary to ensure the development of truly fair and effective multimodal large language models.

In these cases, the system generates multiple responses to the same prompt.  Responses matching the ground truth are labeled as 'chosen responses,' while those that don't match are 'rejected responses.' The bottom half presents examples where ground truth is unclear.  Here, the 'DropoutNTP' method is used: the model generates a response, truncates it, and then attempts to complete the truncated response without the image context. This generated completion acts as the 'rejected response', while the original, complete response is the 'chosen response'. Differences between chosen and rejected responses are highlighted in italics, and incorrect answers are highlighted in red.

The models evaluated include a baseline model, a model fine-tuned with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and a model fine-tuned using the proposed mixed preference optimization (MPO) method. The benchmarks cover a range of tasks, and the table shows the performance scores for each model on each benchmark.  The MPO model demonstrates significantly improved performance compared to both the baseline model and the SFT model, especially on TheoremQA and IFEval.

> üîº This table presents the results of experiments evaluating various preference optimization algorithms applied to the M3CoT benchmark.  For each algorithm (DPO, RSO, IPO, CDPO, RobustDPO, BCO, SPPO, AOT, TR-DPO), the table shows the accuracy scores achieved when the model generates responses directly (Direct) and when it uses chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning.  The final column, Œî, indicates the performance difference between CoT and direct responses, providing insights into how each optimization method affects the model's reasoning capabilities. A positive Œî value suggests CoT improves the model while a negative Œî indicates CoT reasoning reduces performance.

> üîº This table presents the results of experiments on the M3CoT benchmark, comparing various preference optimization algorithms enhanced with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss.  Each algorithm (DPO, RSO, IPO, CDPO, RobustDPO, BCO, SPPO, AOT, TR-DPO, ORPO) was tested in its original form and then with the addition of SFT loss (denoted by '+'). The table shows the performance of each model configuration in terms of accuracy on direct-answer and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tasks, and calculates the difference (Œî) between the two. The purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating SFT loss into different preference optimization approaches for improving the reasoning abilities of multimodal large language models, particularly in CoT scenarios.

> üîº This table presents a comparison of the performance of three different multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on eight benchmark datasets. The models are InternVL2-8B (baseline), InternVL2-8B-DPO+, InternVL2-8B-BCO+, and InternVL2-8B-MPO.  InternVL2-8B-DPO+ and InternVL2-8B-BCO+ are fine-tuned using the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Binary Classifier Optimization (BCO) methods, respectively. InternVL2-8B-MPO uses the Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO) method introduced in the paper. The benchmarks cover various multimodal reasoning tasks and hallucination evaluation.  The results show that the MPO model significantly outperforms the baseline and the DPO+ and BCO+ models on most of the benchmarks.

> üîº This table presents an ablation study on the effect of varying the dropout ratio in the Dropout Next-Token Prediction (DropoutNTP) method used for generating negative samples in the MMPR dataset.  The dropout ratio determines the portion of a positive response that's truncated before the model attempts completion. The table shows the impact of using different dropout ratios (0.25, 0.50, and 0.75) on the hallucination rates measured by two different metrics: response-level and mention-level hallucinations.  The results are presented for the Object HalBench and MMHalBench datasets.
