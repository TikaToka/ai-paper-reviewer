### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically convert HTML web pages to plain text before feeding them to Large Language Models (LLMs). This process loses crucial structural and semantic information present in the HTML, potentially leading to less accurate and more hallucinated outputs.  This paper addresses this limitation by proposing HtmlRAG, a novel approach. 

HtmlRAG uses HTML as the knowledge format in RAG systems.  To overcome the challenges of processing long HTML sequences containing irrelevant information (e.g. CSS, JavaScript), the authors introduce HTML cleaning and compression strategies, followed by a two-step pruning method that leverages both text embedding and a generative model to select relevant HTML blocks.  Extensive experiments on six different QA datasets demonstrate that HtmlRAG significantly outperforms existing text-based methods.  The paper thus suggests a paradigm shift in how external knowledge is processed within RAG pipelines.

> üîº The figure illustrates the loss of structural and semantic information that occurs when converting HTML to plain text.  The left side shows an HTML table with clear structure and semantic meaning (indicated by tags and formatting). The right side displays the same information rendered as plain text, where the original table structure and semantic cues (like <code> tags or <a> tags) are lost. This loss makes the information less precise and less easily understandable by LLMs, which rely heavily on structural information and semantic cues to process and understand text effectively.

### In-depth insights


#### HTML in RAG
The use of HTML in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems presents a compelling approach to enhance knowledge representation and retrieval.  **Traditional RAG systems often convert HTML to plain text, resulting in a significant loss of structural and semantic information.**  This loss can negatively impact the LLM's ability to accurately comprehend and generate responses based on the retrieved knowledge.  The core idea of leveraging HTML directly is to preserve the rich structure inherent in web pages.  **This structure, encompassing headings, tables, and other formatting elements, provides invaluable context that aids LLM understanding.**  However, challenges remain; HTML often includes extraneous elements (JavaScript, CSS) which could introduce noise and increase the computational load. The paper's approach in handling this is by employing techniques like **HTML cleaning and pruning**, which is aimed at streamlining the HTML by removing irrelevant content while retaining critical semantic information.  **The strategy involves a two-step block-tree based pruning method**, leveraging both embedding-based and generative model approaches to achieve optimal efficiency and performance.  In essence, this exploration into using HTML in RAG showcases a powerful paradigm that could greatly enhance the capabilities of LLMs and overcome some limitations associated with conventional text-based retrieval methods.

#### HTML Cleaning
The process of "HTML Cleaning" in this research paper is crucial for effectively leveraging HTML in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.  **The core objective is to reduce noise and irrelevant information from raw HTML documents** which are frequently very lengthy and contain non-semantic elements like CSS, JavaScript, and comments.  These elements unnecessarily inflate the input length for LLMs while offering minimal semantic value.  Therefore, this cleaning phase significantly prepares the HTML for further processing by removing these elements. This process is **rule-based**, not model-based, ensuring efficiency and avoiding potential errors arising from nuanced semantic interpretation of HTML. The cleaning process also includes structural compression techniques such as merging multiple layers of nested tags and removing empty tags. This stage ensures semantic information remains preserved while significantly compressing the HTML document, making it more manageable and computationally efficient for LLMs to process.  **The lossless nature** of the cleaning process is critical, ensuring that no vital semantic content is lost and only the noise and excessive elements are removed, thereby directly impacting the efficiency of the RAG system.

#### Block Tree Pruning
The core of the proposed HtmlRAG system lies in its innovative 'Block Tree Pruning' method.  This technique efficiently manages the excessive length of HTML documents retrieved from the web, a common challenge in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).  Instead of directly pruning the HTML's Document Object Model (DOM) tree which is too granular and computationally expensive, HtmlRAG constructs a more manageable **block tree**.  This hierarchical structure groups DOM nodes into blocks, allowing for a more efficient pruning strategy that minimizes information loss. The pruning process is a two-stage approach; the first leverages a text embedding model to prune coarse-grained blocks based on their relevance to the user query, while the second stage employs a generative model to refine the pruning process at a finer granularity.  This two-step process balances computational cost and effectiveness, ensuring that crucial semantic information is retained.  The **generative model**, in particular, proves invaluable in handling finer-grained blocks that might be overlooked by the embedding model, resulting in a more accurate and concise HTML representation suitable for processing by LLMs. The whole approach highlights the benefits of maintaining HTML's structural information, ultimately enhancing LLM performance and reducing the risk of hallucinations.

#### Experimental Results
The 'Experimental Results' section of a research paper is crucial for demonstrating the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach.  A strong presentation would involve a clear comparison of the novel method (e.g., HtmlRAG) against several established baselines across multiple datasets.  **Quantitative metrics**, such as Exact Match, Hit@1, ROUGE-L, and BLEU scores, should be reported to enable precise comparisons and highlight statistically significant improvements.  It is vital to **carefully select datasets** representing diverse scenarios and complexities to demonstrate the robustness of the method. The discussion should not just present numbers, but also offer a **thorough analysis of trends and patterns**, explaining any unexpected results or limitations.   **Visualizations**, such as bar charts or tables, can significantly enhance readability and facilitate the understanding of the results. Finally, a comprehensive discussion on the implications and limitations of the experimental setup is essential for responsible and insightful reporting.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this HtmlRAG work could explore several key areas.  First, **investigating alternative HTML pruning strategies** beyond the two-step approach presented here would be valuable.  Exploring more sophisticated methods, potentially incorporating LLMs more deeply into the pruning process itself, might yield better results while maintaining efficiency. Second, **extending the framework to handle other document formats** beyond HTML is crucial.  While HTML is a common format, integrating with PDF, DOCX, and other types would vastly broaden applicability. This would require research into robust conversion methods that minimize information loss. Third, **a more thorough investigation into the interplay between HTML structure and LLM understanding** is needed.  Further analysis could reveal optimal ways to leverage HTML features to improve LLM performance and reduce reliance on extensive pre-processing. Fourth, **focus on robustness and generalization**.  The current study primarily focuses on specific types of QA datasets and search engines.  Broadening testing to different data sources, question styles, and LLMs would build stronger confidence and help uncover limitations.
