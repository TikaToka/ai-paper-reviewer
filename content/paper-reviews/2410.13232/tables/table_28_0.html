You will be given web-based tasks.</td></tr><tr><td>Here's the information you'll have:</td></tr><tr><td>The user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.</td></tr><tr><td>The current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information. The current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.</td></tr><tr><td>The previous action: This is the action you just performed.

By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0, i.e., `type [id] [content] [0]'.</td></tr><tr><td>`hover [id]' : Hover over an element with id. press [key_ comb]` : Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).
