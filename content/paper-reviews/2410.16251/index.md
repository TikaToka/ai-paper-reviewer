### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

This paper introduces HalluEditBench, a new benchmark for evaluating knowledge editing techniques in Large Language Models (LLMs).  It addresses the issue that existing datasets don't ensure LLMs generate hallucinations before editing, making it hard to assess the true effectiveness of knowledge editing.  HalluEditBench creates a large dataset of real-world LLM hallucinations and evaluates editing methods across five dimensions: Efficacy (how well it fixes hallucinations), Generalization (how well the fix applies to different questions), Portability (how well the fix works in related questions), Locality (whether the fix affects unrelated knowledge), and Robustness (how resistant the fix is to manipulation). The study reveals that the effectiveness of knowledge editing is highly dependent on both the LLM and the domain, with parameter-preserving methods showing more robustness but lower generalization. This benchmark provides valuable insights into knowledge editing's potentials and limitations, guiding future research in improving these methods.
