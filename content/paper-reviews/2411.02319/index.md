### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Generating realistic 3D and 4D scenes from images is challenging due to the lack of large-scale datasets and effective model designs. Current methods struggle with dynamic content creation and handling varying numbers of input images. This paper tackles these issues by proposing GenXD, a unified model for high-quality 3D and 4D scene generation.  It also introduces a new large-scale dataset, CamVid-30K, specifically designed to improve the training and evaluation of 4D generation models.

GenXD employs innovative multiview-temporal modules to efficiently disentangle camera and object movements, enabling seamless learning from both 3D and 4D data.  Masked latent conditions provide flexibility, allowing for the use of any number of conditioning views without modifying the model. Extensive evaluations demonstrate GenXD's effectiveness in generating realistic videos and 3D-consistent views, showcasing its superiority over existing methods in both single and multi-view scenarios.

### In-depth insights


#### 4D Scene Synthesis
The research paper introduces GenXD, a novel framework for high-quality 3D and 4D scene generation.  A key contribution is its ability to handle **4D scene synthesis** from various numbers of conditional images.  GenXD leverages a data curation pipeline that estimates camera poses and object motion from videos, creating the CamVid-30K dataset for training.  The model incorporates multiview-temporal modules to disentangle camera and object movements, leading to more realistic and consistent 4D outputs.  **Masked latent conditioning** allows GenXD to adapt to different numbers of input views without modification, further enhancing flexibility.  The results demonstrate GenXD's effectiveness in generating videos that faithfully follow camera trajectories and exhibit realistic object motion, surpassing the performance of other existing methods in both 3D and 4D generation tasks.

#### CamVid-3D Dataset
The provided text does not contain a heading titled 'CamVid-3D Dataset'.  Instead, it describes a 'CamVid-30K' dataset, a large-scale real-world 4D scene dataset created by curating video data.  **The process involves estimating camera poses via Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and identifying moving objects using instance segmentation**.  A key innovation is the introduction of 'motion strength', a metric that quantifies object movement, which is used to filter out static scenes.  This meticulous approach ensures only dynamic scenes with detectable object motion are included, resulting in **approximately 30,000 high-quality 4D video samples**.  The dataset's significance lies in addressing the scarcity of real-world 4D data, crucial for advancing the field of 4D scene generation and related dynamic 3D tasks.

#### GenXD Framework
The GenXD framework is a unified model for high-quality 3D and 4D scene generation from any number of condition images.  It leverages a **mask latent conditioned diffusion model** to handle various conditioning views without modification.  GenXD's core innovation lies in its **multiview-temporal modules**, which disentangle camera and object movements, enabling seamless learning from both 3D and 4D data.  These modules use an **α-fusing strategy** to merge spatial and temporal information for 4D data, while removing temporal information for 3D data.  **Object motion strength** estimated from the CamVid-30K dataset is incorporated to better control object motion in video generation. The model's ability to effectively manage and combine multi-view and temporal data makes it a powerful tool for a range of 3D and 4D generation tasks.

#### Ablation Studies
The ablation study in the research paper investigates the impact of **motion disentanglement** and **camera conditioning** on the model's performance.  Results reveal that **disentangling camera and object motion is crucial for high-quality 3D and 4D generation**.  Removing this disentanglement significantly reduces performance.  Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of the **motion strength** parameter in controlling the magnitude of object movement, demonstrating that accurately representing object motion improves generation quality. The effectiveness of the proposed **mask latent conditioning** approach for handling multiple input views is also validated.  The results emphasize the model's sensitivity to data representation and the importance of careful data curation and model design choices for effective 3D and 4D generation.

#### Future Directions

> 🔼 This figure illustrates the data curation pipeline used to create the CamVid-30K dataset.  The pipeline consists of two main stages: camera pose estimation and object motion estimation. Camera pose estimation starts by using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) on masked images to reconstruct 3D point clouds from the static elements in the scene. This process leverages masks that highlight the static areas.  Next, relative depth is estimated, aligned with the sparse depth obtained from SfM, and used to project the tracking keypoints onto consecutive frames. Object motion estimation involves identifying moving objects, calculating their motion field in the 2D video frames using keypoint tracking. The motion field helps determine the true object motion, removing static scenes from the data, and finally resulting in the CamVid-30K dataset.

We first leverage mask-based SfM (masks are overlayed to images in (a) for visualization) to estimate camera pose and reconstruct 3D point clouds of static parts. Then relative depth is aligned with the sparse depth and project the tracking keypoints to consecutive frame for object motion estimation.

The left panel shows a scenario where a girl is dancing while the camera also moves; this results in a relatively high motion strength value. The right panel presents a case where the camera zooms in on a static object. Here, the motion strength is significantly lower, as the object itself is not moving, despite camera movement.
