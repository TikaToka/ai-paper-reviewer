<table id='1' style='font-size:14px'><tr><td>Prompt: Multi-task Data Synthesizing ECG Report: {report} Task Type: Present your work in this format: Task: [Concise content of the ECG tasks, including required output format. Do not include phrases like "Output format:... " or like "[Insert image here]", but in more natural expression. ] Response: [Comprehensive response following the task's requirements, strictly based on the report] Do not include any content outside of the Task and Response sections.</td></tr><tr><td>Your task: Create a complex ECG visual task based on the given report and target task type: Guidelines for task creation: 1. Design a concise yet challenging graduate-level task that requires deep reasoning. 2. Frame the task as interacting with an actual ECG image, without mentioning the report. Make the task visually centric, assuming direct ECG image analysis. 3. Strictly base all information on the given ECG report only. Avoid tasks and answers that are inconsistent with the report. 4. Avoid restating the report or using phrases like "As described in the report." 5. Generate one task from a diverse range of task types, including but not limited to: Direct questions (e.g. "What is the heart rhythm?") Hypothetical scenarios (e.g. "Imagine you're an ER doctor reviewing this ECG... ") Comparative tasks (e.g. "How does this ECG differ from a normal sinus rhythm?") Explanation requests (e.g. "Explain the significance of the QS complexes seen in V2. ") Problem-solving scenarios (e.g. "Given these ECG findings, what further tests might you order?") Educational prompts (e.g. "Teach a medical student about the key features of this ECG. ") Role-playing scenarios (e.g. "You're consulting with a cardiologist about this ECG. What do you tell them?") Decision-making tasks (e.g. "Based on this ECG, would you clear this patient for surgery? Why or why not?") 6. Specify a clear, appropriate output format within the task instructions(free-form, "think-step-by-step", direct output the short answer(in one phrase or one sentence), JSON format, table, list, different delimiters(such as commas, semicolons, numeric order), etc.). Do not limited to the given task type and format, you have the freedom to design any type of task you deem appropriate. 7. Focus the task on one or more of the following ECG analysis aspects: a. Basic ECG feature interpretation (e.g. heart rate, rhythm, cardiac axis) b. Diagnosis and classification (e.g. diagnosis identification, waveform classification, rhythm classification) c. Waveform and interval analysis (e.g. P wave morphology, PR interval, QT interval, QRS complexes, T wave morphology) 8. Ensure the task complexity aligns with the given report's information. After creating the task: 1. Provide a detailed, accurate answer to your own task. 2. Ensure your answer is comprehensive and strictly based on the report. 3. Strictly follow the output format and requirements specified in your task instructions. Target {target}</td></tr></table>
