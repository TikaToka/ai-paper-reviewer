<table id='0' style='font-size:14px'><tr><td>Prompt: Evaluation of ECG Arena</td></tr><tr><td>Evaluate the quality of a model's response to an ECG-related question by comparing it with a given ground truth answer. Focus on three aspects: accuracy, completeness, and instruction adherence. Be precise and objective, especially when identifying errors in medical terminology. Do not let the response length affect your evaluation. Evaluation Criteria: 1. Accuracy (0-10): How well does the model's response match the ground truth, particularly in ECG interpretation and diagnosis? This score emphasizes whether the key information is correct, such as the correct identification of waveforms, intervals, and clinical diagnoses. - 10: Fully accurate, with correct ECG interpretation, terminology, and diagnosis. - 5: Partially accurate, with some correct information but notable errors or omissions. - 0: Largely inaccurate or misleading.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>2. Completeness (0-10): points missing. - 0: Instruction Adherence (0-10):</td></tr><tr><td>Does the response cover essential aspects of ECG interpretation (e.g., rhythm, axis, waveforms, clinical causes) mentioned in the ground truth? This score focuses on whether the answer is comprehensive and includes as much essential information as possible. - 10: Comprehensive, covering all key details. - 5: Partially complete, with important Incomplete, lacking critical information.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>3. Does the model follow the specific in the question (e.g., listing features, suggesting well the model follows the</td></tr><tr><td>instructions a diagnosis)? This score focuses on how task instructions, regardless of the correctness of the answer. - 10: Fully follows instructions. - 5: Partially follows instructions, with some deviations. - 0: Fails to follow instructions or provides an irrelevant response. Please organize your output in a JSON format of accuracy, completeness, and instruction adherence, with a brief explanation of each aspect.
