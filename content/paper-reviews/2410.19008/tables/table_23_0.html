<table id='0' style='font-size:14px'><tr><td>Prompt: Multi-turn Dialogue Synthesizing</td></tr><tr><td>Your task: Create a 2-4 turn dialogue between a medical professional and an AI assistant analyzing an ECG, based on the given report:</td></tr><tr><td>Guidelines for dialogue creation: 1. Design a series of questions and answers that progressively explore the ECG findings in depth, suitable for graduate-level medical professionals. 2. Frame the dialogue as if the medical professional is directly analyzing an actual ECG image, without mentioning the report. Make the conversation visually centric, assuming direct ECG image analysis. 3. Strictly base all information on the given ECG report only. Avoid including details inconsistent with the report. 4. Do not use phrases like "As described in the report, " "The report mentions," or "The term... " The dialogue should not appear to reference an external report. 5. Begin with direct questions about basic ECG features, then progress to more complex interpretations and clinical implications. 6. Include a mix of question types, with an emphasis on direct questions: - Direct questions (e.g., "What are the main ECG features?", "What is the heart rhythm?") - Requests for explanations (e.g., "Can you explain the significance of the QS complexes?", "What the cause of these features?") - Clinical reasoning questions (e.g., "Given these findings, what's your diagnosis?") - Hypothetical scenarios (e.g., "How would you manage a patient presenting with this ECG?") 7. Focus the dialogue on one or more of the following ECG analysis aspects: a. Basic ECG feature interpretation (e.g., heart rate, rhythm, cardiac axis) b. Diagnosis and classification (e.g. diagnosis identification, waveform classification, rhythm classification) C. Waveform and interval analysis (e.g. P wave morphology, PR interval, QT interval, QRS complexes, T wave morphology) d. Clinical implications and management 8. Ensure the dialogue complexity aligns with the given report's information. After creating the dialogue: 1. Provide extremely comprehensive and detailed answers from the AI assistant's perspective. Each response should thoroughly cover all relevant aspects of the question asked. 2. Ensure all answers are comprehensive and strictly based on the report, without explicitly referencing it. 3. Make the dialogue flow naturally, as if a real user is progressively exploring the ECG findings. 4. Structure the AI assistant's responses to be highly readable: - Break down complex information into digestible parts. - Use bullet points or numbered lists to organize information - Include brief explanations of medical terms or concepts when necessary - Provide context for why certain findings are significant Aim for a balance between depth of information and clarity of presentation in each response.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ECG Report: {report}</td></tr><tr><td>Present your work in this format: Human: [First question about the ECG]</td></tr><tr><td>Assistant: [Comprehensive response based strictly on the report]</td></tr><tr><td>Human: [Follow-up question delving deeper into the ECG analysis]</td></tr><tr><td>Assistant: [Detailed answer providing further insights]</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>[Continue the dialogue for up to 2 more turns if necessary, ensuring a natural progression of inquiry] Do not include any content outside of the dialogue format. Ensure that the entire conversation appears to be about analyzing an actual ECG image, without any indication that the information comes from a written report.</td></tr></table>
