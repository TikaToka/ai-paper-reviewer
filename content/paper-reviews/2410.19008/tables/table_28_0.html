<table id='1' style='font-size:14px'><tr><td>Case Study: PTB-XL Report</td></tr><tr><td>Question: Please write a clinical report based on this ECG image. 11 Ground Truth Report: Sinus rhythm. Prolonged PR interval. R-S transition zone in V leads displaced to the left. Voltages  are high in limb leads suggesting left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). ST segments are depressed in leads I, II, aVL, V5, and V6. T waves are flat in these leads. Non-specific but consistent with myocardial changes.</td></tr><tr><td>PULSE Response: The electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals a sinus rhythm, indicating that the heart is beating in a regular, rhythmic pattern, with a normal heart rate and P-wave morphology. The PR interval is prolonged, measuring longer than the normal range of 120-200 milliseconds, suggesting a delay in the conduction of electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles. This prolongation may be indicative of a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, which can be a benign finding but may also be associated with underlying cardiac conditions. The ECG also demonstrates high voltages in the limb leads, specifically leads I, II, and III, which is suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). This finding is consistent with an increase in the thickness of the left ventricular wall, which can be a response to chronic pressure overload or volume overload. The ST segments are depressed in leads I, II, aVL, V5, and V6, indicating a possible alteration in the repolarization pattern of the ventricles. This depression may be indicative of left ventricular strain or ischemia, which can be a sign of myocardial injury or infarction. Furthermore, the T waves are low or flat in leads I, II, aVL, V5, and V6, which may be a manifestation of left ventricular strain or ischemia. The combination of these findings, including the prolonged PR interval, high voltages in the limb leads, and ST segment depression, suggests that the patient may be experiencing myocardial ischemia, which is a condition where the heart muscle does not receive sufficient blood flow, leading to a mismatch between oxygen demand and supply. In conclusion, based on the ECG findings, the diagnosis is consistent with myocardial ischemia, left ventricular hypertrophy, T wave abnormality, prolonged PR interval, and sinus rhythm.</td></tr><tr><td>LLM-as-Judge Feedback for PULSE Response: 1. Diagnosis Score: 10. Explanation: The generated report correctly identifies all key diagnoses present in the ground truth report, including sinus rhythm, prolonged PR interval, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), ST segment depression, and T wave abnormalities. The interpretation of these findings as consistent with myocardial ischemia is also accurate. 2. Form Score: 10. Explanation: The generated report accurately describes the waveform abnormalities, including the prolonged PR interval, high voltages in the limb leads, ST segment depression in leads I, II, aVL, V5, and V6, and flat T waves in these leads. These descriptions match the ground truth report precisely. 3. Rhythm Score: 10. Explanation: The generated report correctly identifies the rhythm as sinus rhythm, which is consistent with the ground truth report. The description of the rhythm is clear and accurate. Final Score: (10+10+10)/3 * 10 = 100</td></tr><tr><td>GPT-4o Response: Clinical Report: Electrocardiogram (ECG) ECG Interpretation: Heart Rate: The heart rate appears to be within normal limits. Precise calculation of the heart rate is recommended for confirmation. Rhythm: The rhythm appears to be regular. There are consistent R-R intervals, suggesting a regular sinus rhythm. P Waves: P waves are present before each QRS complex, indicating sinus rhythm. The morphology of the P waves appears normal. PR Interval: The PR interval appears to be within normal limits (120-200 ms). QRS Complex: The QRS duration appears to be within normal limits (less than 120 ms). There is no evidence of significant QRS complex abnormalities such as bundle branch block. ST Segment: The ST segments appear to be isâŒ€electric (flat) in most leads, with no significant elevation or depression noted. T Waves: T waves appear to be upright in leads I, II, V3-V6, and inverted in aVR, which is normal. There are no significant T wave abnormalities noted. Axis: The QRS axis appears to be normal. The exact axis calculation is recommended for confirmation. Additional Observations: There are no significant signs of ischemia, infarction, or other acute changes. No evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy or other chamber enlargement. Conclusion: This ECG shows a normal sinus rhythm with no significant abnormalities. The patient's ECG is within normal limits for her age and clinical presentation.</td></tr><tr><td>LLM-as-Judge Feedback for GPT-4o Response: 1. Diagnosis Score: 0. Explanation: The generated report fails to identify key diagnoses present in the ground truth report. It does not mention the prolonged PR interval, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), ST segment depression, or flat T waves. Instead, it incorrectly states that there are no significant signs of ischemia, infarction, or other acute changes, and no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. 2. Form Score: 0. Explanation: The generated report inaccurately describes the waveform morphology. It incorrectly states that the PR interval is within normal limits, fails to identify the high voltages in limb leads, and does not mention the ST segment depression or flat T waves. These are critical waveform abnormalities that are present in the ground truth report. 3. Rhythm Score: 5. Explanation: The generated report correctly identifies a regular sinus rhythm, which is consistent with</td></tr></table>
