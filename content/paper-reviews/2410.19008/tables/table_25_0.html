<table id='0' style='font-size:14px'><tr><td>Prompt: Evaluation of Report Generation</td></tr><tr><td>Evaluate the alignment and quality of a generated ECG report by comparing it to a ground truth clinician's report. The evaluation will focus on three key aspects: Diagnosis, Waveform, and Rhythm. Use specific criteria for each aspect and be precise in comparing medical terminologies. Only focus on information present in the ground truth report, identifying any mistakes. Remain objective and do not let the response length affect your evaluation. Evaluation Criteria: 1. Diagnosis (0-10): Assess how well the generated ECG report matches the clinical diagnoses in the ground truth report. Focus on conditions like conduction disturbances, ischemia, hypertrophy, and other abnormalities as presented in the ground truth report. - 10: All key diagnoses are correctly identified with no errors or omissions. - 5: Partially accurate, with some diagnoses identified correctly but key conditions missing or incorrect. - 0: Fails to identify key diagnoses, with multiple critical errors.</td></tr><tr><td>2. Waveform (0-10): Evaluate the accuracy and quality of the ECG waveform morphology in the generated report compared to the ground truth. Focus on abnormalities in P-wave, QRS complex, ST changes, T-wave, and intervals (PR, QT), ensuring waveform morphology is consistent with the ground truth. - 10: All waveform abnormalities are correctly identified without errors. - 5: Some waveform abnormalities are identified, but key issues are missed or misinterpreted. - 0: Fails to identify key waveform abnormalities, with multiple critical errors.</td></tr><tr><td>3. Rhythm (0-10): Assess the accuracy and clarity of rhythm interpretation in the generated report. Focus on identifying and describing normal and abnormal rhythms (e.g., sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia) as presented in the ground truth report. - 10: Rhythm interpretation is fully accurate and clearly described. - 5: Rhythm interpretation is partially accurate but contains notable errors or omissions. - 0: Rhythm interpretation is largely incorrect, with critical errors. Please organize your output in a JSON format of diagnosis, form and rhythm, with a brief explanation of each aspect. For example: {Diagnosis: {Score: $SCORE$, Explanation: $EXPLANATION$}} [The Start of Ground Truth Report] {ground_ truth_report} [The End of Ground Truth Report] [The Start of Generated Report] {generated_report} [The End of Generated Report]</td></tr></table>
