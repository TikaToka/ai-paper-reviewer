<table id='0' style='font-size:14px'><tr><td>Case Study: PTB-XL Report</td></tr><tr><td>Question: Please write a clinical report based on this ECG image. Ground Truth Report: Sinus rhythm. T waves are low or flat in V3, V4, V5 and slightly inverted in V2. Non-specific but consistent with myocardial ischemia. The age of the changes is uncertain.</td></tr><tr><td>PULSE Response: The electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals a normal sinus rhythm, characterized by a regular heartbeat with a rate between 60-100 beats per minute, indicating that the heart's natural pacemaker, the sin⌀atrial (SA) node, is functioning properly. The axis of the heart's electrical activity is also within normal limits, suggesting that the electrical impulses are being conducted through the heart in a normal and coordinated manner. However, the ST segment and T waves exhibit abnormalities, which may be indicative of myocardial ischemia or strain, particularly in the anterior region of the heart. This could be a sign of reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, potentially leading to damage or even necrosis of the myocardial tissue. The presence of these abnormalities in the ST segment and T waves suggests that the heart is under stress, which may be caused by a variety of factors, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, or cardiomyopathy. Overall, the diagnosis based on this ECG report is sinus rhythm with ST changes, indicating that the heart is functioning normally in terms of rhythm, but is exhibiting signs of potential myocardial ischemia or strain.</td></tr><tr><td>LLM-as-Judge Feedback for PULSE Response: 1. Diagnosis Score: 8. Explanation: The generated report correctly identifies the sinus rhythm and the presence of abnormalities in the ST segment and T waves, which are consistent with myocardial ischemia. However, it does not specifically mention the low or flat T waves in V3, V4, V5, and the slightly inverted T wave in V2, which are key details in the ground truth report. 2. Form Score: 7. Explanation: The generated report accurately identifies the presence of ST segment and T wave abnormalities, which are indicative of myocardial ischemia. However, it lacks the specific details about the T wave morphology in V2, V3, V4, and V5, which are crucial for a precise comparison with the ground truth report. 3. Rhythm Score: 10. Explanation: The generated report correctly identifies the sinus rhythm and provides a clear and accurate description of the heart's rhythm, matching the ground truth report. Final Score: (8+7+10)/3 * 10 = 83.3</td></tr><tr><td>GPT-4⌀ Response: ECG Interpretation: 1. Heart Rate: The heart rate is approximately 75 beats per minute, which is within the normal range (60-100 bpm). 2. Rhythm: The rhythm appears to be regular with consistent R-R intervals, indicating a normal sinus rhythm. 3. P Waves: P waves are present before each QRS complex, indicating normal atrial depolarization. The P wave morphology is normal. 4. PR Interval: The PR interval is within the normal range (120-200 ms), suggesting normal atrioventricular conduction. 5. QRS Complex: The QRS duration is within the normal range (less than 120 ms), indicating normal ventricular depolarization. There are no significant Q waves observed, which rules out previous myocardial infarction. 6. ST Segment: The ST segments are is⌀electric (flat) in all leads, indicating no signs of acute ischemia or injury. 7. T Waves: T waves are upright in leads I, II, V3-V6, and inverted in aVR, which is a normal finding. There are no signs of T wave inversion or hyperacute T waves. 8. QT Interval: The QT interval appears to be within the normal range (less than 440 ms for males and less than 460 ms for females), indicating no prolonged QT syndrome. 9. Axis: The QRS axis is normal, approximately 0 to +90 degrees. 10. Additional Observations: No evidence of left or right ventricular hypertrophy. No signs of bundle branch block or other conduction abnormalities. Conclusion: The ECG findings are within normal limits. There are no signs of acute ischemia, infarction, or other significant cardiac abnormalities. The patient has a normal sinus rhythm with normal atri⌀ventricular and intraventricular conduction.</td></tr><tr><td>LLM-as-Judge Feedback for GPT-4o Response: 1. Diagnosis Score: 0. Explanation: The generated report fails to identify the key diagnosis of myocardial ischemia indicated by the T wave abnormalities in the ground truth report. It incorrectly concludes that there are no signs of acute ischemia or other significant cardiac abnormalities. 2. Form Score: 0. Explanation: The generated report does not mention the low or flat T waves in V3, V4, V5, and the slightly inverted T waves in V2, which are critical waveform abnormalities noted in the ground truth report. Instead, it incorrectly states that T waves are upright in V3-V6 and does not acknowledge any T wave inversion. 3. Rhythm Score: 10. Explanation: The generated report correctly identifies the rhythm as normal sinus rhythm, which is consistent with the ground truth report. Final Score: (0+0+10)/3 * 10 = 33.3</td></tr></table>
