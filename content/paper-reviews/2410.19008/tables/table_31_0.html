<table id='1' style='font-size:14px'><tr><td colspan="2">Question:</td></tr><tr><td>What can be inferred from the pattern leads of this ECG image? Ground Truth Answer: The pattern of qR complexes in leads I and aVL, along with rS complexes in leads II, III, and aVF, is characteristic of a Left Anterior Fascicular Block (LAFB). In LAFB, the ECG typically shows small Q waves and tall R waves in leads I and aVL (qR complexes), and small R waves followed by deep S waves in leads II, III, and aVF (rS complexes). This pattern is a result of the altered conduction through the left anterior electrical activity to spread upwards and leftwards in the heart, leading to these Follow-up Question: What is the key feature that supports the diagnosis in this ECG image? Ground Truth Answer: The left axis deviation (LAD) observed in the ECG is a key feature that supports the diagnosis of Left Anterior Fascicular Block (LAFB). LAD is indicated by the negative deflections in leads II, III, and aVF, and positive deflections in leads I and aVL. In LAFB, the abnormal conduction pathway leads to the electrical axis of the heart shifting towards the left, which manifests as a left axis deviation on the ECG. This deviation, combined with the specific patterns of qR complexes in leads I and aVL and rS complexes in leads II, III, and aVF, strongly suggests LAFB.</td><td>of the qR complexes and rS complexes in the #: fascicle, which causes the distinctive ECG findings.</td></tr></table>
