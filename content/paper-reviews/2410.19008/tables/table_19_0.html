<table id='0' style='font-size:14px'><tr><td colspan="2">Training Data Examples: Heart Rhythm Analysis</td></tr><tr><td>Instruction: Analyze the ECG image and identify the combination of cardiac rhythm abnormalities that can be diagnosed simultaneously in this patient. Rank the abnormalities in order of their potential impact on the patient's hemodynamic stability, with 1 being the most critical. Use a semicolon-separated list with the rhythm abnormality followed by its severity ranking Response: Sinus tachycardia; 1; Right bundle branch block; 3; Premature atrial contraction; 2; Premature ventricular contraction; 2. Justification: Sinus tachycardia is ranked as the most critical abnormality since it can output, increased myocardial oxygen demand, and potentially exacerbate underlying cardiac atrial contractions and premature ventricular contractions are ranked equally as they can both disrupt normal cardiac function, although their individual impact might be less severe than sinus tachycardia. Right bundle block, while still a significant abnormality, is ranked last as it may not have an immediate on hemodynamic stability, but rather serves as an indicator of underlying cardiac pathology.</td><td>lead to decreased cardiac conditions.
