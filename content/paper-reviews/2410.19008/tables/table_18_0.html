<table id='0' style='font-size:14px'><tr><td>Training Data Examples: Basic Feature Recognition</td></tr><tr><td>Instruction: What are the main ECG features I'm seeing here? Response: Let's break it down. We have a rhythm that appears to be irregular, with varying P-P intervals. The heart rate is not explicitly stated, but based on the ECG tracing, it seems to be within the normal range. The cardiac axis appears to be normal as well. One notable T T feature is the presence of an rSr' pattern in lead V1, which is likely a normal variant.  I + I  Additionally, we can see some nonspecific T wave changes in the septal leads. Follow-up Instruction: Can you explain the significance of the rSr' pattern in lead V1? Is it a cause for concern? Response: The rSr' pattern in lead V1 is often seen in healthy individuals, especially in younger people. It's considered a normal variant because it doesn't necessarily indicate any underlying cardiac pathology. The "r" represents a small initial positive deflection, followed by a larger negative deflection (the "S" wave), and then a secondary positive deflection (the "r'"). This pattern is thought to be related to the normal activation sequence of the right ventricle. Since it's isolated to lead V1 and doesn't appear to be associated with any other abnormalities, it's unlikely to be a cause for concern in this case.</td></tr><tr><td>Sub-task: Basic Waveform Understanding; Question type: Open-ended; Source dataset: MIMIC-IV-ECG</td></tr><tr><td>Instruction: What can be inferred about the heart's electrical conduction system based on this ECG? Options: A. There is a block in the electrical conduction pathway B. There is an abnormality in the heart's electrical conduction system C. The heart's electrical conduction system is functioning normally D. There is a rhythm disturbance Response: This image indicates that the heart's electrical conduction system is functioning normally, as there are no apparent abnormalities or disturbances in the electrical activity. The presence of a sinus rhythm and a normal axis suggests that the heart's electrical conduction system is operating within normal limits, without any significant defects or anomalies. This ECG image is consistent with a normal heart, and there is no evidence of any conduction system abnormalities. We can conclude that the answer is C. The heart's electrical conduction system is functioning normally</td></tr><tr><td>Sub-task: Conduction System Interpretation; Question type: Multi-choice QA; Source dataset: PTB-XL</td></tr><tr><td>Instruction: You are reviewing an ECG tracing in a clinical setting.
