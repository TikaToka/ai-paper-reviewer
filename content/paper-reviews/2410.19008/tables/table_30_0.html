<table id='0' style='font-size:14px'><tr><td>Case Study: PTB XL Report</td></tr><tr><td>Question: Please write a clinical report based on this ECG image. 5~1~ thanderning Ground Truth Report: 小 FREENTING sinus arrhythmia, left axis deviation, left anterior hemiblock, right bundle branch block, bifascicular block, abnormal QRS(T), possible lateral myocardial damage ? 1011 ����</td></tr><tr><td>PULSE Response: The electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals a sinus arrhythmia, characterized by an irregular heart rhythm with varying intervals between beats, originating from the sin⌀atrial node. This arrhythmia is often benign and can be influenced by factors such as respiration, with heart rate increasing during inhalation and decreasing during exhalation. The ECG also demonstrates an overdriven left type, indicating that the left ventricle is dominant in the cardiac conduction system, which can be a normal variant or associated with certain cardiac conditions. Furthermore, the ECG shows evidence of left anterior hemiblock, a conduction defect affecting the anterior fascicle of the left bundle branch, resulting in delayed activation of the anterior wall of the left ventricle. This can be a sign of underlying cardiac disease or injury. Additionally, the presence of right bundle branch block is noted, indicating a conduction defect affecting the right bundle branch, leading to delayed activation of the right ventricle. The combination of left anterior hemiblock and RBBB is consistent with bifascicular block, a condition where two of the three main fascicles of the cardiac conduction system are affected. The ECG also reveals a left axis deviation, indicating that the electrical axis of the heart is shifted to the left, which can be a normal variant or associated with certain cardiac conditions such as left ventricular hypertrophy or cardiomyopathy. Overall, the ECG findings are consistent with a diagnosis of left axis deviation, sinus arrhythmia, left anterior fascicular block, and right bundle branch block.</td></tr><tr><td>LLM as Judge Feedback for PULSE Response: 1. Diagnosis Score: 7. Explanation: The generated report correctly identifies sinus arrhythmia, left axis deviation, left anterior hemiblock, and right bundle branch block. It also correctly identifies the combination of left anterior hemiblock and RBBB as bifascicular block. However, it fails to mention 'abnormal QRS(T)' and 'possible lateral myocardial damage,' which are key diagnoses. 2. Form Score: 5. Explanation: The generated report accurately describes the conduction defects (left anterior hemiblock, right bundle branch block) and left axis deviation. However, it does not address 'abnormal QRS(T)' and 'possible lateral myocardial damage,' which are critical waveform abnormalities mentioned in the ground truth report. 3. Rhythm Score: 10. Explanation: The generated report provides a detailed and accurate description of sinus arrhythmia, including its characteristics and potential influences. This matches the rhythm interpretation in the ground truth report. Final Score: (7+6+10)/3 * 10 = 73</td></tr><tr><td>GPT 4o Response: Clinical Report: Electrocardiogram (ECG) Analysis: 1. Heart Rate and Rhythm: Heart Rate: Approximately 75 beats per minute (bpm). Rhythm: Sinus rhythm is present, as indicated by the presence of P waves before each QRS complex and a consistent PR interval. 2. Intervals and Durations: PR Interval: 152 ms (within normal range: 120 200 ms). QRS Duration: 125 ms (slightly prolonged; normal range: 80 120 ms). QT Interval: 421 ms (QT interval, QTcB: 447.5 ms, QTcF: 439.0 ms; within normal limits for QTc). 3. Axis: QRS Axis: 72.0 degrees (left axis deviation). P Axis: 71.5 degrees. T Axis: 73.0 degrees. 4. Waveform Analysis: P Waves: Normal morphology, consistent in all leads. QRS Complexes: Slightly widened, indicating a possible intraventricular conduction delay. ST Segment: No significant elevation or depression noted. T Waves: Normal morphology, no inversion or significant abnormalities observed. 5. Additional Observations: Lead V1 V6: Normal R wave progression. No evidence of acute ischemia or infarction. No significant arrhythmias detected. Conclusion: The ECG shows a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of approximately 75 bpm. There is a slight prolongation of the QRS duration, suggesting a possible intraventricular conduction delay. The QRS axis is deviated to the left. No acute ischemic changes or significant arrhythmias are noted. The overall findings are within normal limits, with minor deviations that may warrant further clinical correlation and follow up.</td></tr><tr><td>LLM as Judge Feedback for GPT 4o Response: 1. Diagnosis Score: 5. Explanation: The generated report correctly identifies left axis deviation but misses several key diagnoses present in the ground truth report, such as sinus arrhythmia, left anterior hemiblock, right bundle branch block, bifascicular block, abnormal QRS(T), and possible lateral myocardial damage. The generated report mentions a possible intraventricular conduction delay, which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth report. 2. Form Score: 5. Explanation: The generated report correctly identifies the left axis deviation and slightly prolonged QRS duration. However, it fails to identify the abnormal QRS(T) and possible lateral myocardial damage mentioned in the ground truth report. The generated report also does not mention any abnormalities in the P-wave, ST changes, or T-wave, which are critical for a comprehensive waveform analysis. 3. Rhythm Score: 5. Explanation: The generated report identifies a sinus rhythm but misses the sinus arrhythmia mentioned in the ground truth report. The generated report does not identify any significant arrhythmias, which is a notable omission given the ground truth report's mention of sinus arrhythmia. Final Score: (5+5+5)/3 * 10 = 50</td></tr></table>
