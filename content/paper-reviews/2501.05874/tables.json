However, based on the information provided, we can infer that Rose learned how to use a potter\u2019s wheel at Greenwich House after seeing Vally Wiselthier\u2019s preliminary pieces. This suggests that she may have received some training or instruction in pottery from Vally Wiselthier or other instructors at Greenwich House.<br/>To make a clay rose, you would need to follow these general steps:<br/>1. Gather materials: You will need clay, a potter\u2019s wheel, a wire cutter, a sponge, and any additional materials you want to use for decoration (such as glaze, paint, or glitter).<br/>2. Prepare the clay: Cut a piece of clay to the desired size and shape for your rose. Use a wire cutter to trim any excess clay and smooth out any rough edges.<br/>3. Shape the clay: Use your hands or tools to shape the clay into a rose. You can start by creating a small ball of clay for the center of the rose, then add petals around it. Use a sponge to smooth out any rough areas and refine the shape of the rose.<br/>4. Add details: Use a tool or your fingers to add details to the petals, such as veins or shading. You can also use additional materials like glaze, paint, or glitter to decorate the rose.<br/>5. Allow the clay to dry: Let the clay dry completely before firing it in a kiln. This will help prevent any cracking or breaking during the firing process.<br/>6. Fire the clay: Place the dried clay rose in a kiln and fire it according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. This will harden the clay and create a durable piece of pottery.<br/>7. Glaze or finish: Once the clay is fired, you can apply a glaze or finish to give the rose a glossy or matte appearance. Allow the glaze to dry and cure before handling the finished piece.<br/>It\u2019s important to note that this is a general guide and the specific steps may vary depending on the type of clay you are using and the techniques you are employing. It\u2019s also important to follow safety guidelines when working with clay and kilns.</span> | \n| VideoRAG-V |  | \n|---|---| \n| **Question** | Explain how to make a clay rose. | \n| **Retrieved Video** | ![](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.05874/x6.png) | \n| **Generated Answer** | To make a clay rose, start by rolling out a piece of clay into a flat sheet. Use a rolling pin to flatten the clay further. Then, use a knife or sculpting tool to cut the clay into petal shapes. Roll the petals into a spiral shape to form the rose. Use a small tool to create indentations in the petals for texture. Assemble the petals around a central stem, shaping them to resemble a rose. Add leaves and other details as desired. Finally, use a mold to imprint patterns onto the petals, adding depth and realism to the rose. | \n| **Ground Truth** | To make a clay rose, start by rolling a chunk of clay into a ball, dividing the ball into seven similarly-sized pieces, and rolling those pieces into balls. Take the smallest ball and press it into a guitar-pick-shaped \u201cpetal\u201d with the pointy part thicker than the rounded part, then fold the sides gently inward. Repeat with a slightly bigger ball of clay, then fold this second petal around the first. Continue attaching slightly larger petals in a spiral, then pinch the bottom of your rose to connect all the petals. | ", "caption": "Table 6: Case study comparing TextRAG (BM25) and VideoRAG-V approaches.", "description": "\ud45c 6\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd, \uc989 TextRAG(BM25)\uc640 VideoRAG-V\ub97c \ube44\uad50 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.
