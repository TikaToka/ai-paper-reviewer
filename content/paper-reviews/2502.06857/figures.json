We vary delta and see that a delta of 10\u22125superscript10510^{-5}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT is highly unstable when fitting on smaller grid sizes. On the left, we plot only fitting on data less than 100100100100 billion tokens. On the right, we plot fitting on all data up to 350350350350 billion tokens. We see that including more data increases the stability of the exponents found for smaller grid sizes for deltas 10\u22124,10\u22125superscript104superscript10510^{-4},10^{-5}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT.", "description": "\uadf8\ub9bc 20\uc740 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \uac80\uc0c9 \ud06c\uae30(x\ucd95)\uc640 \uc608\uce21\ub41c \ud1a0\ud070\uc758 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30(y\ucd95)\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub378\ud0c0 \uac12\uc744 \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc740 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud06c\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \ub378\ud0c0 10\u207b\u2075\uac00 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc67c\ucabd \uadf8\ub9bc\uc740 1000\uc5b5 \ud1a0\ud070 \ubbf8\ub9cc\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub9cc \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, \uc624\ub978\ucabd \uadf8\ub9bc\uc740 \ucd5c\ub300 3500\uc5b5 \ud1a0\ud070\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uba74 \ub378\ud0c0 10\u207b\u2074, 10\u207b\u2075\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub354 \uc791\uc740 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud06c\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uacac\ub41c \uc9c0\uc218\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub428\uc744 \uc54c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "section": "3.2.
