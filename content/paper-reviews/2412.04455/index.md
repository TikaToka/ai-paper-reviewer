### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current robotic systems struggle with open-set failure detection; they either react after a failure or struggle to prevent foreseeable ones.  Existing methods often lack speed, accuracy, or generality.  This limits their real-world applicability and necessitates more robust solutions.

Code-as-Monitor (CaM) tackles these limitations by formulating both reactive and proactive failure detection as constraint satisfaction problems, using vision-language models to generate executable code for real-time monitoring.  **CaM introduces constraint elements that simplify tracking and improve monitoring efficiency.** The results demonstrate that CaM improves success rates and reduces execution time significantly compared to baselines across various tests.  **It exhibits strong generalization capabilities in dynamic environments**.

(a) shows reactive detection where a failure (lobster jumping out) is identified after it occurs. (b) illustrates proactive detection, where a potential failure (pan tilting) is detected and corrected before it causes a problem. Both scenarios use spatio-temporal constraints to identify and resolve issues.

### In-depth insights


#### Reactive Failure Detect
Reactive failure detection, a critical aspect of robust robotic systems, focuses on identifying failures **after** they occur.  This contrasts with proactive detection, which aims to prevent failures before they happen.  A thoughtful reactive system requires **real-time monitoring** of the robot's state and environment to quickly identify deviations from expected behavior.  **Sensor data** plays a crucial role in this process, enabling rapid identification of unexpected events like object drops or collisions.  Effective reactive detection necessitates a well-defined set of **failure criteria**, allowing the system to distinguish between normal operational variations and actual failures.  Furthermore, a successful system should incorporate **immediate feedback mechanisms** such as re-planning or corrective actions to mitigate the consequences of detected failures.  The success of reactive failure detection is ultimately judged by its ability to **minimize downtime** and prevent catastrophic system failures.  The design of a robust and effective reactive failure detection system requires careful consideration of multiple factors.  **Accuracy, speed, and resilience** are vital characteristics.  Balancing these factors is essential for creating a truly reliable and safe robotic system.

#### Visual Programming
The concept of 'Visual Programming' in the context of robotics, as discussed in the research paper, represents a significant shift towards more intuitive and efficient methods for robot control and failure detection.  It leverages the power of **vision-language models (VLMs)** to translate high-level task instructions and visual observations into executable code that directly monitors spatio-temporal constraints. This approach moves beyond traditional textual programming, offering a more **accessible and user-friendly interface** for designing robot behaviors. The use of **constraint elements**, abstract geometric representations of relevant entities, further simplifies the visual programming process. By enabling **real-time constraint monitoring** through code evaluation, visual programming offers increased efficiency and accuracy in both reactive and proactive failure detection, adapting to unseen situations with greater flexibility than text-based methods alone.  The **integration of visual programming with open-loop policies** allows for more robust and adaptable closed-loop systems in complex dynamic environments. In essence, visual programming is not just a novel technique; it's a paradigm shift that profoundly affects how robots are programmed and how failures are addressed.

#### Constraint Elements
The concept of 'Constraint Elements' appears crucial for bridging the gap between high-level task instructions and low-level robot control.  These elements act as **intermediaries**, abstracting complex real-world entities and their spatial relationships into simpler geometric representations (points, lines, surfaces). This abstraction is key for several reasons: **efficiency**, enabling real-time monitoring without the computational overhead of processing raw sensory data; **generalization**, allowing the system to adapt to variations in object appearances and environmental conditions; and **interpretability**, simplifying the task of specifying and verifying constraints for both reactive and proactive failure detection.  **Visual programming** is facilitated by representing these elements as visual prompts, making the monitoring process more intuitive and easier to design. By leveraging **spatio-temporal constraints** on these elements, the system can effectively and precisely detect failures, whether anticipated or unexpected, significantly improving the robustness and reliability of closed-loop robotic systems.

#### Real-world Testing
Real-world testing of robotic systems is crucial for validating the effectiveness and robustness of algorithms and control policies developed in simulated environments.  A successful real-world test should demonstrate the system's ability to handle unexpected events and uncertainties inherent in unstructured environments. **The challenges of real-world testing include the difficulty of replicating the complexity and variability of real-world conditions in simulation, the cost and time required to conduct extensive experiments, and the safety implications of deploying robots in uncontrolled settings.**  A well-designed real-world test should consider various factors, such as the choice of test environment, the types of tasks performed, the presence of disturbances or failures, and the metrics used to evaluate performance.  The results of the testing phase should provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the system, leading to improvements in design and implementation. **Data collected from real-world testing is invaluable for further refinement and validation of the system, potentially leading to more robust and reliable robotic systems suitable for deployment in a variety of real-world applications.**  Ideally, the results will contribute to a better understanding of how to translate algorithms effectively from simulation to the real world, bridging the gap between theory and practice.

#### Future Directions
Future research directions for this work could explore several promising avenues.  **Extending the constraint element framework** to encompass a wider range of failure modes, particularly those involving subtle force interactions or nuanced sensory data (e.g., sounds, temperature changes), is crucial.  This could involve incorporating more sophisticated geometric primitives or integrating multimodal sensing capabilities.  **Improving the robustness and generalization of the VLM-generated code** is essential. Research on techniques for mitigating hallucinations and enhancing the reliability of code execution in dynamic real-world scenarios should be prioritized.  Furthermore,  **exploring the integration with advanced planning and control algorithms** would enable the development of more sophisticated closed-loop systems capable of handling long-horizon tasks in complex and unpredictable environments. Finally, **benchmarking the system** on a wider variety of robotic tasks and environments, coupled with a thorough comparative analysis against state-of-the-art methods, would provide valuable insights into the overall performance and limitations of the proposed approach.

> üîº The figure illustrates the Code-as-Monitor (CaM) framework, which unifies reactive and proactive failure detection in robotics.  Given a task instruction (e.g., 'Move the pan with the bread to the stove without dropping the bread'), the Constraint Generator analyzes multi-view observations and determines the next subgoal and its associated textual constraints. The Painter module converts these textual constraints into visual representations (constraint elements) overlaid on the images.  The Monitor module then uses these visual elements to generate and execute code that performs real-time monitoring for constraint satisfaction. If a constraint is violated, the Monitor outputs the reason for failure, triggering re-planning.  The use of constraint elements simplifies the monitoring process and enhances the generality and real-time performance of the system.

Given task instructions and prior information, the Constraint Generator derives the next subgoal and corresponding textual constraints based on multi-view observations. The Painter maps these constraints onto images as constraint elements. The Monitor generates monitor code from these images and tracks them for real-time monitoring. If any constraint is violated, it outputs the reason for failure and triggers re-planning. This framework unifies reactive and proactive failure detection via constraints, more generally abstracts relevant entities/parts through constraint elements, and ensures precise and real-time monitoring via code evaluation.

> üîº The figure illustrates the process of generating constraint elements from multi-view images.  First, the ConSeg model generates instance-level and part-level masks from multiple camera views. These masks are then projected into 3D space. A series of heuristics are applied to the 3D point cloud to identify and extract the desired constraint elements. Finally, these elements are annotated back onto the original multi-view images for visualization and use in subsequent monitoring tasks.  The figure shows the annotation result for a single constraint element.

> üîº The figure showcases the architecture of ConSeg, a model designed for constraint-aware part-level segmentation.  It takes as input a textual constraint describing the desired object part and a corresponding image.  The model processes the image via a vision encoder and uses a vision-language model (VLM) to generate an embedding based on the textual constraint and the visual features. This embedding is used by a decoder to produce the segmentation mask identifying the specific part of the object that satisfies the constraint. The output includes both the mask and a description (element type) of the segmented part. This method ensures precise segmentation of only the relevant parts required for constraint satisfaction, aiding in visual programming.

> üîº This figure illustrates the three-step process for collecting the dataset used in the paper.  First, GPT-4 is used to analyze each trajectory from the BridgeData V2 dataset [32], breaking down the task instructions into individual subgoals, identifying constraints (both during execution and upon completion), and defining the object-part relationships involved in each subgoal. Second, using external information, such as gripper states, each frame of the trajectory is linked to the corresponding subgoal, constraints, and object-part associations. Finally, pre-trained models (Grounded SAM [51] and Semantic SAM [33]) automatically generate instance and part-level segmentation masks. Manual review and filtering are then used to refine the dataset, removing any errors or low-quality annotations.

Because the RoboFail dataset was not used in training the model, this visualization demonstrates the model's ability to generalize to unseen data and perform accurate segmentation of task-relevant elements even in novel scenarios.
