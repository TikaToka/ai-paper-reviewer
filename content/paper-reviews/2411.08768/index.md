### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Extracting user actions from desktop recordings is valuable for automating processes, creating personalized user experiences, and generating tutorials.  However, this area has been largely unexplored. Existing video analysis methods often struggle with the complexities of desktop interfaces and the rich temporal dynamics of user interactions.  This paper addresses this gap by proposing two methods to extract user action sequences from desktop recordings, using Vision-Language Models (VLMs). 

The proposed methods are evaluated on two benchmark datasets, one self-curated and another adapted from prior work. The Direct Frame-Based Approach, which directly inputs video frames into VLMs, outperforms the Differential Frame-Based Approach, demonstrating the potential of VLMs for this task. The study also shows that the accuracy of user action extraction ranges from 70% to 80%, with the extracted action sequences being replayable through Robotic Process Automation (RPA). This work represents the first application of VLMs for extracting user action sequences from desktop recordings, paving the way for novel applications and research.

### In-depth insights


#### VLM-based Action Extraction
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) present a novel approach to user action extraction from desktop recordings.  **Direct Frame-Based (DF) approaches** directly feed video frames to the VLM for action sequence generation, leveraging the model's inherent ability to correlate visual information with actions.  **Differential Frame-Based (DiffF) methods**, conversely, pre-process the video by detecting changes using computer vision, then inputting these differences to the VLM.  While DiffF aims to improve performance by highlighting relevant changes, results suggest that **DF generally outperforms DiffF**, potentially because explicit UI change extraction can introduce noise that degrades VLM accuracy.  This highlights the complexity of integrating computer vision with VLMs for this task. **Benchmark datasets** are crucial for evaluating these approaches and future research should focus on developing more realistic and diverse benchmarks to push the boundaries of VLM-based action extraction.

#### Benchmark Datasets
The creation of robust benchmark datasets is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of user action extraction methods from desktop recordings.  A well-designed benchmark should consider **diversity in terms of user actions**, encompassing a range of interaction types (clicks, drags, scrolls, selections, typing) and varying levels of complexity.  The datasets should also exhibit **variations in UI design and application types**, reflecting the heterogeneous nature of real-world desktop environments.  Furthermore, **data quality and annotation accuracy** are paramount; inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the ground truth labels can significantly impact the reliability of the evaluation.  Finally, the size of the dataset needs careful consideration, balancing the need for sufficient data to capture variability with the practical constraints of data collection and annotation effort.  Ideally, the datasets should also have clearly defined metrics that align with the research goal.  The use of multiple benchmark datasets‚Äîone focused on individual action types and another reflecting real-world scenarios‚Äîenhances the rigor of the evaluation process and helps identify the limitations of proposed methods in various contexts.

#### Method Comparison
A robust method comparison necessitates a multi-faceted analysis.  It should delve into the **performance metrics** achieved by each method, considering factors like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  Furthermore, a thorough examination of the **computational costs** associated with each method is crucial. This includes assessing the required computational resources, processing time, memory usage, and overall efficiency.  It is essential to compare methods on **diverse datasets**, ensuring the chosen datasets adequately represent real-world variability.  A qualitative comparison also matters; aspects such as **implementation complexity**, model interpretability, and ease of generalization should be evaluated. Finally, a **discussion of the strengths and weaknesses** of each method, highlighting their suitability for various contexts, is critical for a complete comparison. This holistic approach will lead to a more informed decision on selecting the most appropriate method for any given task.

#### Error Analysis
A dedicated 'Error Analysis' section in a research paper provides crucial insights into the limitations and potential improvements of proposed methods.  It systematically examines instances where the model's performance deviates from expectations. This involves identifying the types of errors, their frequency, and potential causes, such as **visual hallucinations**, where the model incorrectly interprets visual data, or **reasoning failures**, where the model's logic breaks down.  Analyzing error patterns helps to pinpoint weaknesses in the model's architecture or training process.  For example, frequently occurring visual hallucinations might suggest the need for improved data augmentation or more robust feature extraction techniques.  Similarly, recurring reasoning failures might highlight the need for a more sophisticated reasoning module or a better understanding of the task's underlying complexities.  **A thorough error analysis is critical for evaluating the reliability and robustness of a model and for guiding the development of more accurate and reliable systems.**  The analysis can also reveal unexpected model behaviors or highlight previously unconsidered factors influencing performance.  Ultimately, this section provides valuable feedback, supporting future research directions and improving the overall trustworthiness of the findings.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this work on VLM-based user action extraction from desktop recordings could focus on several key areas.  **Improving the robustness of the current methods** to handle diverse recording conditions (e.g., varying video quality, different UI styles) is crucial for real-world applicability.  Exploring more sophisticated VLM architectures or training strategies, possibly incorporating temporal modeling techniques more explicitly, could significantly enhance performance. **Developing more comprehensive benchmark datasets** with a wider range of user actions and interaction scenarios is vital to objectively evaluate future advancements.  The integration of additional modalities, such as audio or mouse cursor data, presents a promising avenue to improve accuracy and contextual understanding. Finally, **investigating applications beyond RPA** such as automated tutorial generation, personalized user experience design, or anomaly detection in user behavior, warrants further exploration.

> üîº The figure illustrates the architecture of the Differential Frame-Based Approach (DiffF) for extracting user action sequences from desktop recordings.  It shows the different processing stages involved: First, a Frame Difference Localizer identifies UI changes between consecutive frames.  Then, a Frame Difference Descriptor generates textual descriptions of these changes. Finally, an Action Proposer and Action Corrector leverage vision-language models to interpret these descriptions and generate the final action sequence.  The DiffF method differs from the Direct Frame-Based Approach by explicitly incorporating UI changes, enabling a comparison of the effectiveness of these different approaches.

| - You are a post-processing agent.
| - Your input is a sequence of user operations extracted from the interface images, which may contain errors or redundancies.
| - Your task is to post-process the operations according to the <GUIDELINE> of the post-processing.
| - You should output the chain of thoughts according to the <GUIDELINE> of the chain of thoughts before the final result.
| - Output the final result in a structured format according to the <FORMAT> of the output.
| # <GUIDELINE> of the post-processing
| ## Check the redundant operations
|   - First, you should check the adjacent operations, and if the adjacent operations are the same operation, and their target_object is the same, you should keep the first operation and remove the redundant operation. E.g., if there are two "click" operations on the same button, you should keep the first "click" operation and remove the second "click" operation.
|   - Second, you should check the adjacent operations, and if the one operation is the sub-operation of the other operation, you should remove the sub-operation. E.g., if there is a "click" operation followed by a "drag" operation, you should remove the "click" operation and keep the "drag" operation.
| ## Check the reasonableness of the operations
|   - First, you should check the operation category according to Your thoughts. If the operation category is not reasonable, you should correct it.
|   - Second, you should check the target_object according to the thoughts and abstract. If the target_object is not reasonable, you should correct it.
|   - Third, you should check the application according to the thoughts and abstract. If the application is not reasonable, you should correct it.
| ## Check the completeness of the operations
|   - First, you should check the additional_info according to the operation category. If the additional_info is missing, you should complete it.
|   - Second, you should check the abstract according to the operation category, target_object, application, and additional_info. If the abstract is missing or not fluent, you should complete or correct it.
| # <GUIDELINE> of the chain of thoughts
| - First, check the redundant operations according to the <GUIDELINE> of the post-processing. And give the reason why you think the operation is redundant.
| - Second, check the reasonableness of the operations according to the <GUIDELINE> of the post-processing. And give the reason why you think the operation is not reasonable.
| - Last, check the completeness of the operations according to the <GUIDELINE> of the post-processing. And give the reason why you think the operation is not complete.
| # <GUIDELINE> of the output
| - The output should be in strictly valid JSON format, with no extra text or characters before or after the JSON.
| - If there are no user operations, you must return the ‚Äòuser_operations‚Äô key with an empty list as its value.
| Example output format:
| {
|   "user_operations": [
|     {
|       "thoughts": "The mouse is near the ‚Äòhello world‚Äô and the background of the text changed",

| - You are an operation merge agent.
| - You will receive a list of user operations that are extracted from video frames using the sliding window method; the definition of the input is in <INPUT DETAIL>.
| - Your task is to delete the repeated operations caused by the overlapping of the adjacent windows and merge the entire operation sequence, you can refer to the <GUIDELINE FOR MERGING> for the merging rules.
| - You should output the merged operation sequence in the same format of <OUTPUT FORMAT>
| # <INPUT DETAIL>:
| - The input is a list of user operations extracted from the video frames.
| - Each item in the list is a JSON object containing the start and end frame of the sliding window,with a list of user operations extracted from the window.
| # <GUIDELINE FOR MERGING>:
| - For each pair of neighboring sliding windows, pay attention to actions at the end of the previous window and those at the beginning of the next window, check if certain actions match one of the following merging criteria:
|  - Are there "drag" actions on the same element (or different element description referring to the same element) in the same app?
|   - Write these actions down, which should be merged into one "drag" later.
|  - Are there scroll actions on the same element (or different element descriptions referring to the same element) in the same app?
|   - Write these actions down, which should be merged into one "scroll" later.
|  - Are there "type" actions in the same app?
|   - For such "type" actions, is earlier action "additional_info" (the typed text) a prefix of later action "additional_info"? If so, they actually belong to the same sequence of character typing and should be merged into one "type" action.
|   - Write the actions satisfying the conditions, which should be merged to one "type" later.
|  - Are there "select" actions in the same app?
|   - For such "select" actions, is earlier action "additional_info" (selected items) a subset/superset of later action "additional_info"? If so, they actually belong to the same sequence of selecting and should be merged into one "select" action.
|   - Write the actions satisfying the conditions, which should be merged to one "select" later.
|  - Is there a "select" (or "click") action followed by a "drag" action on the same element (or different element description referring to the same element) in the same app?
|   - Confirm if "select" is followed by "drag".
|   - Write the actions satisfying the conditions, which should be merged into one "drag" later.
|  - Is there a "select" (or "click") action followed by a "drag" action on same element (or different element description referring to the same element) in the same app?
|   - Confirm if "select" is followed by "drag".
|   - Write the actions satisfying the conditions, which should be merged into one "drag" later.
| # <OUTPUT FORMAT>:
| - The output should be in JSON format.
| - The JSON object should contain an array of user operations, each represented as a JSON object containing the extracted information for that operation.
|  Example output format:

| Task | Description |
|---|---| 
| <TASK 4>: correct "element" field for "scroll" actions | Now you have to revise the "element" field of the action triples you just wrote. Consider the "scroll" action triples only, leaving all other actions intact. For each scroll action in a web browser tab, output "element" as "<vertical/horizontal> scroll bar of <visible tab title>". Confirm whether the scroll bar is vertical or horizontal by looking at the UI change events that support the scroll action. For every other scroll action, output "element" as "<vertical/horizontal> scroll bar of <UI element being scrolled>". Confirm whether the scroll bar is vertical or horizontal by looking at the UI change events that support the scroll action. Rememeber to leave the correct "element" values and all other fields intact in your output JSON object. If no correction is needed, simply output your prvious JSON object EXACTLY as it is, so that the downstream system can notice that no correction is made. To complete your task, first write down your step-by-step thoughts on how to correct/remove the "element" fields of the "scroll" actions if they have these issues. If one "element" field needs correction, but the current action item does not include enough information to correct it, make sure to go back to its supporting UI change events (find them by ids indicated in "evidences" and "region" fields) to review the original UI change events and correct the "element" field accordingly. After your thinking, output the complete and valid JSON object of actions with each of the "element" fields corrected. |
| <TASK 5>: correct "element" field for "type" actions | Now you have to revise the "element" field of the action triples you just wrote. Consider the "type" action triples only, leaving all other actions intact. The typed content might be either text or other content: If text was typed: the "element" field should contain the typed text in single quotes (WITHOUT extra explanatory words like "text"), instead of the UI element like "textbox"; Make sure to summarize the complete typed text, by reviewing the "region" and "evidences" events that support the "type" action; It may happen that the text you found from the UI events are still incomplete due to missing keyframes, so you should also take a look of the regions AFTER the "region" and "evidences" events (region ids are in form of "<frame>_<index>", so you should look at regions of greater frame numbers, not smaller) to infer the complete typed text. If such later regions exist, add the region ids to the "evidences" field of the current action. If Something else is typed, observe among the the events: what content has appeared before I-beam cursor locations in the changed regions close-in-time to the "region" and "evidences" regions (that is, frame id should not differ with more than 2). Describe the new content briefly in the "element" field (without quotes). If new content has appeared in a UI event region, add its id to the "evidences" field of the current action. Rememeber to leave the correct "element" values and all other fields (except when you need to add more region ids to "evidences" of a "type" action) intact in your output JSON object. If no correction is needed, simply output your prvious JSON object EXACTLY as it is, so that the downstream system can notice that no correction is made. To complete your task, first write down your step-by-step thoughts on how to correct/remove the "element" fields of the "type" actions if they have these issues.

{{< table-caption >}}
| - If items were dragged:
| | - Does the "app" in which the drag happend allow dragging multiple items? If so, one or more items may be dragged; otherwise, only one item may be dragged. Some common apps:
| | | - Desktop: allow dragging multiple selected icons.
| | | - Taskbar: does not allow dragging multiple icons.
| | | - File Explorer: allow dragging multiple selected files.
| | | - Microsoft Word: allow dragging multiple selected lines, which must be contiguous.
| | | - List (in general): if items are selected, they can be dragged at the same time.
| | - Name the items(s) being dragged specifically in "element", avoiding vague descriptions like "icons" or "items".
| | - To identify the items being dragged, revisit the "region" and "evidences" events that support the "drag" action. In particular, what items kept moving in every supporting "region" and "evidences"? Were they moving with the cursor? During drag, some elements may move when their place was occupied by the dragged item. These items did not keep in all events following the cursor, and their movement was not caused directly by the drag, therefore they should not be included as dragged items.
| - If text was dragged:
| | - the "element" field should contain the dragged text in single quotes (WITHOUT extra explanatory words like "text"), instead of the UI element like "textbox";
| | - Observe selected text during the drag action, as text must be in selected state to be dragged;
| | - Revisit "text_content_change" events that happened between start and end of drag actions. Does the selected text appear or disappear in these events? If so, it is likely that the text was dragged and moved, instead of being changed. The reason is that due to low frame sampling rate (1FPS), dragged/moved text may look like changed, while the intermediate dragging animation may be missing in low FPS keyframes.
| | Rememeber to leave the correct "element" values and all other fields (except when you need to add more region ids to "evidences" of a "drag" action) intact in your output JSON object.
| | If no correction is needed, simply output your prvious JSON object EXACTLY as it is, so that the downstream system can notice that no correction is made.
| | To complete your task, first write down your step-by-step thoughts on how to correct/remove the "element" fields of the "drag" actions if they have these issues.
| | Your thoughts must include the following steps:
| | - Find out the "app" in which the drag happend. Does the app allow dragging multiple items? If so, one or more items may be dragged; otherwise, only one item may be dragged.
| | - In "region" and "evidences" events that support the "drag" action, which items have moved? List them.
| | - Among these items, which items kept moving in every supporting "region" and "evidences"? Were they moving with the cursor? During drag, some elements may move when their place was occupied by the dragged item. These items did not keep in all events following the cursor, and their movement was not caused directly by the drag, therefore they should not be included as dragged items.
| | - List the items that kept moving in all supporting events with the cursor.
| | - Review all UI events: in which event has one of the above specifaclly been selected? List them here for latet steps
| | - If you found multiple items in the previous step, review the supporting events in "region" and "evidences", to see if they were moving in a translation manner, that is, in parallel. Items that have exchanged location or reordered cannot possibly have been dragged at the same time (since it is NOT a translation motion), and hence should not be included in the "element" field. List the items that were BOTH selected and moving in a translation manner.
| | - If you found multiple items in the previous step, list all of them here for later output of "element" IF the app allows dragging multiple items; otherwise, list only one item here, which seems to be the most likely dragged item.
| | If one "element" field needs correction, but the current action item does not include enough information to correct it, make sure to go back to its supporting UI change events (find them by ids indicated in "evidences" and "region" fields) to review the original UI change events and correct the "element" field accordingly.
| | After your thinking, output the complete and valid JSON object of actions with each of the "element" fields corrected.
| <TASK 7>: correct the "click" actions by analyzing their "evidences"
| Now you have to revise the "evidences" field of the "click" action triples you just wrote. Consider the "click" action triples only, leaving all other actions intact.

> üîº Table XX provides the continuation of instructions for the Action Corrector task within the methodology section of the paper.  This part focuses on correcting the 'element' field for drag actions, handling multiple drag events and ensuring accuracy. It details steps to validate if the app allows multiple item dragging and to identify the actual items dragged, emphasizing the need to consider only items moving consistently with the cursor and in a parallel manner. It includes instructions for handling incomplete information by reviewing supporting events, and lastly, instructions for merging actions of the same type.

| Step | Description | 
|---|---| 
| 1 | Write down what is expected to happen if the click action was actually performed and walk through ALL UI events after the frame where the click supposedly happened (not only the evidences of the action) to check if the expected UI change actually happened. For example:  Clicking on a taskbar icon should open the corresponding app window, or display it if already open. Clicking on a dropdown menu should open the dropdown menu, or close it if it was already open. | 
| 2 | Distinguish between "click" and "hover": Some style changes happen on "hover", and UI events would have been different than if it was a "click". For example, most slight text/background color change would likely be caused by "hover". | 
| 3 | Indicator of "hover": the cursor moved over the element and then quickly moved out. After moving out, the element‚Äôs looking changes back to the original state (the looking before cursor coming acrossing the element). Make sure to check a few frames before and after the evidence of this action to see if it‚Äôs the case. | 
| 4 | After the above steps, write down the updated list of evidences for this action, taking your above thoughts into account. Keep the evidences that support the "click" action, and remove the evidences that indicate a "hover" action or another action type or no action at all. | 
| 5 | After your thinking, output the complete and valid JSON object of actions with each of "click" action corrected and all other actions intact. For each "click" action, if the new "evidences" list is non-empty, then keep the action item with updated "evidences" and all other fields unchanged. If the new "evidences" list is empty, then remove the action item from the list of actions. | 
| 6 | merge actions: Now you have to revise the actions of type "type", "select", "drag", "click" you just wrote to see any of the same type actions are mergeable, leaving all the other actions intact. | 
| 7 | Identify all groups of actions that should have been merged, output one single merged action where: "action" is the common action type of the actions being merged; "element" is a summary of "element" fields of all actions being merged, which contains all information of each individual "element". If "element" is in form of a set (e.g. set of icons, text as set of characters), use the "element" of the latest action (latest means greatest frame id); "app" is the common app shared by all actions being merged; "evidences" is the union of "evidences" fields of all actions being merged; "region" is the region of the latest action (latest means greatest frame id); all other fields are the same as the latest action (latest means greatest frame id). | 
| 8 | Indicators of actions of same type: The actions happen in same app (necessary but not sufficient condition); The actions have overlapping evidences or evidences that interleave or are close in time (in terms of id; evidences close in time must differ at most by 2 in frame id); For "type" actions, earlier action "element" (in terms of frame id) is a prefix of later action "element", since text is typed in a sequence; For "select" actions, earlier action "element" (in terms of frame id) is a subset OR superset of later action "element", since more or less text/items are selected during these frames. | 
| 9 | Remember to leave the correct actions intact in your output JSON object. If no merging is needed, simply output your previous JSON object EXACTLY as it is, so that the downstream system can notice that no correction is made. | 
| 10 | To complete your task, first write down your step-by-step thoughts on how to merge the actions. For each of the groups of actions that should have been merged, based on the above indicators of actions of same type, your thoughts must include the following steps: Find all groups of actions that should have been merged, based on the above indicators of actions of same type; make sure their action type is the same and one of "type", "select", "drag", "click". Otherwise they should not be merged; make sure they are in same app, otherwise they should not be merged; If the action type to merge is "type": is earlier action "element" (in terms of frame id) a prefix of immediate later action "element"?; If the action type to merge is "select": is earlier action "element" (in terms of frame id) a subset OR superset of immediate later action "element"?; Does this group of actions needs further correction by removing some actions and/or adding more actions? Make sure to go back to the supporting UI change events (find them by ids indicated in "evidences" and "region" fields) of each action under consideration to see if it‚Äôs to be added or removed from the group; Avoid "over-merging": do not merge actions into one while they actually represent more than one action. Check the supporting UI events of each action in the group to see if they are one or more actions in reality; If the group leads to an "over-merging" the number of true actions is still less than the number of actions in the group, then remember to reason in the same step-by-setp fashion later on each of these subgroups, each corresponding to a true action; write down a conclusion: is this group indeed to merge? | 
| 11 | After your thinking, output the complete and valid JSON object of actions with each of identified group merged, and all other action intact. |

> üîº This table presents the fourth and final part of the prompt given to the Action Corrector, a post-processing module in the proposed method.  It details instructions for merging actions of the same type ('type', 'select', 'drag', 'click') that should have been grouped together in the initial action sequence. The guidelines emphasize identifying groups of actions with overlapping or interleaved evidences (indicating close temporal proximity) and matching action types. Additional criteria are provided for handling 'type' and 'select' actions based on the order of operation and content. The output should be a valid JSON object with merged actions and the original structure maintained for the unchanged actions.
