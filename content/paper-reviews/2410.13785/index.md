### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) need alignment to match human preferences.  Current methods use limited contrasting patterns for training, leading to incomplete alignment and vulnerability to 'jailbreaking'. This paper introduces PopAlign, a framework that uses six new contrasting strategies at the prompt, model, and pipeline levels to create more diverse training data.  Experiments show PopAlign significantly improves alignment compared to existing methods across various tasks and leaderboards.  This demonstrates the importance of diversifying contrasting patterns for achieving more comprehensive and robust LLM alignment, making them more resistant to malicious attacks.

#### Why does it matter?
This paper is significant for researchers working on large language model (LLM) alignment. It introduces a novel framework, PopAlign, which addresses the limitations of existing methods by diversifying contrasting patterns. This approach leads to more comprehensive and robust alignment, mitigating the susceptibility of LLMs to jailbreaking attacks and paving the way for safer and more reliable AI systems.  The six new contrasting strategies proposed are valuable contributions that can inspire further research in LLM alignment and safety.  The detailed experimental results and analysis provide a strong foundation for future work in this crucial area of AI research.

For the other three leaderboards (i.e., MT-Bench, AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena Hard), we use their official GPT evaluation pipeline to obtain a point-wise score. Note that we report length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 tasks due to its higher agreement with human annotation. Higher scores indicate better performance.
