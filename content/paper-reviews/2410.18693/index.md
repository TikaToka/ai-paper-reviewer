### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Researchers created ScaleQuest, a new method to easily make large amounts of high-quality data for training large language models (LLMs).  Instead of relying on expensive, closed-source models like GPT-4, ScaleQuest cleverly uses smaller, open-source models to create math problems and solutions. They made a massive dataset (one million examples!) and tested it on several LLMs.  The results were amazing: the LLMs performed much better on math problems after training with this new dataset.  In fact, it even outperformed LLMs trained with data from proprietary models!  This is important because it means more researchers can now train better LLMs at a lower cost. The process is also scalable, meaning it can easily create even larger datasets in the future.
