<br><table id='4' style='font-size:14px'><tr><td>Problems 1 (Before Optimization):</td></tr><tr><td>How many 4-digit positive integers are there?</td></tr><tr><td>Problems 1 (After Optimization):</td></tr><tr><td>How many 4-digit positive integers can be formed using non-repeating digits where the sum of these digits must be even, and the integers fall within the range of 1000 to 9999?</td></tr><tr><td>Problems 2 (Before Optimization):</td></tr><tr><td>The average of 15 numbers is 32. An additional number is then added to the list, and the new average of the 16 numbers is 34. What number was added to the list?</td></tr><tr><td>Problems 2 (After Optimization): The average of 15 positive integers is 32, but one integer fluctuates to 30 before adding a new number. After adding this new number, the average of the 16 integers becomes 34. Calculate the added number and find the standard deviation of all 16 integers, considering their ascending order.</td></tr><tr><td>Problems 3 (Before Optimization):</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>A fair coin is tossed 50 times, what is the probability of getting heads at least 25 times? Problems 3 (After Optimization):</td></tr><tr><td>A fair coin is tossed 50 times; what is the probability of obtaining heads at least 25 times, and can you also calculate the expected number, variance, and standard deviation of heads while determining the likelihood that the total number of heads exceeds 30?</td></tr></table>
