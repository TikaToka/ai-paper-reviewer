### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Technical debt (TD) detection traditionally relies heavily on textual cues like comments, but these can be outdated or inconsistent with the code.  This paper addresses this limitation by focusing on **a novel approach that integrates both comments and the associated source code**.  This is challenging because analyzing large codebases is computationally expensive and requires sophisticated methods. Existing datasets also lack this crucial code context.

The paper presents **TESORO**, a new dataset created using a pipeline that extracts self-admitted TD comments, links them to relevant code snippets, and has these annotations verified by human annotators. It then uses various machine learning models to demonstrate that incorporating code context greatly improves the accuracy of TD detection.  Furthermore, the study investigates the effectiveness of different models for detecting TD directly from code, without relying on comments.

#### Why does it matter?
This paper is crucial for researchers because it **introduces a novel dataset, TESORO**, which is the first to combine self-admitted technical debt comments with their corresponding source code. This allows for more accurate and comprehensive analysis of technical debt and opens new avenues for research in this field. It also **presents a comprehensive pipeline for data enrichment**, enabling researchers to efficiently create similar datasets for different programming languages and software systems. The empirical evaluations using various machine learning models demonstrate that the dataset improves the performance of technical debt detection methods.

> üîº The Tesoro dataset creation pipeline consists of four main stages: 1. Code parsing: Java files from the Stack corpus are parsed to extract functions and associated comments. 2. SATD detection: A pre-trained classifier identifies comments potentially containing self-admitted technical debt (SATD). 3. Sampling: An algorithm selects high-quality samples for annotation, balancing informative examples and instances with high uncertainty scores. 4. Annotation: Human annotators classify selected comments and their corresponding source code snippets into specific technical debt categories (design, defect, documentation, requirement/implementation, testing). The output of the pipeline is the Tesoro dataset, containing labeled SATD comments and their associated source code, which can be used to train and evaluate models for detecting technical debt in Java source code.

### In-depth insights


#### Enriched TD Dataset
The concept of an 'Enriched TD Dataset' for improving technical debt (TD) detection in Java source code is **crucial** for advancing research in this field.  A simple dataset of comments alone is insufficient; an enriched dataset would integrate source code alongside self-admitted technical debt (SATD) comments, providing a **richer context** for analysis.  This integration would allow researchers to move beyond relying solely on textual cues, which are often outdated or inaccurate, to identify deeper underlying code issues that constitute technical debt. The enrichment would provide a more **robust and comprehensive representation of technical debt**, enabling more accurate and effective machine learning models for TD detection and classification. Furthermore, an enriched dataset could **facilitate more in-depth analysis of the relationship between comments and the corresponding code**, revealing patterns and insights that might otherwise remain hidden. This would ultimately lead to better tools and strategies for managing technical debt and improving the quality of software development processes.

#### SATD Detection Tool
The effectiveness of a SATD detection tool hinges on its ability to accurately identify comments containing technical debt.  **High precision is crucial** to avoid overwhelming human annotators with false positives, thus optimizing labeling efficiency. The choice of model architecture (e.g., RoBERTa) and training data (e.g., Maldonado-62K dataset) significantly influence the tool's performance. Fine-tuning parameters require careful consideration to balance speed and accuracy. The tool's success directly impacts the downstream sampling strategy, affecting the overall quality and representativeness of the curated dataset.  Therefore, rigorous evaluation and iterative refinement of the SATD detection tool are vital for ensuring a high-quality dataset for future research.  **Developing a robust tool is key to efficient data creation** for SATD studies.

#### Code Context Impact
The study explores how incorporating source code context surrounding comments impacts the accuracy of technical debt (TD) detection.  **Different integration techniques** were tested, including simple string concatenation and attention mechanisms that weight the relevance of code tokens to comment tokens. The results reveal that including code context significantly improves performance across various models, demonstrating the value of multi-modal approaches.  **The optimal code context length** wasn't a fixed number; rather, the effectiveness depended on the model, with experiments showing that using either a concise surrounding code segment or the entire function provided benefits.  **An ensemble approach**, combining predictions from models trained with various code context lengths, achieved the highest accuracy, indicating that leveraging both local and global code context is crucial. This highlights the need for future research exploring diverse methods to integrate code and comment data effectively for superior TD detection.

#### PLM Model Accuracy
Analyzing the accuracy of various Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) in detecting technical debt reveals **significant discrepancies in performance**.  While some models, particularly those specifically trained on code (code-based PLMs), demonstrate relatively high accuracy, others, especially those primarily trained on natural language text (NL-based PLMs), show significantly lower performance. This suggests that the **architecture and training data of the PLM are crucial factors** influencing its ability to accurately identify and classify technical debt within source code.  Furthermore, the **integration method used to combine source code and comments with PLM input** also plays a key role.  Simply concatenating the text data may not capture the nuanced relationship between code and comments as effectively as methods which employ attention mechanisms to weight the importance of each part of the input.  Therefore, selecting the most appropriate PLM architecture and input processing method is critical for optimizing the accuracy of technical debt detection.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this work on technical debt detection could significantly enhance the field. **Expanding the dataset to encompass a wider array of programming languages beyond Java is crucial for broader applicability.**  Further investigation into the effectiveness of various deep learning models, particularly exploring advanced architectures like LLMs and their potential in accurately identifying technical debt directly from source code, is warranted.  **Improving the integration techniques for combining source code and comment data could yield even more precise detection.** This might involve exploring more sophisticated attention mechanisms or novel methods of data fusion.  A key area for future work is developing more robust and efficient methods for dealing with the inherent class imbalance problem often found in technical debt datasets. **Investigating techniques such as data augmentation or cost-sensitive learning could prove beneficial.**  Finally, evaluating the long-term implications of incorporating detected technical debt into software development lifecycle processes and measuring the impact on software quality and maintainability is needed to solidify the practical applications of this research.
