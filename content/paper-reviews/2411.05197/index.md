### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many businesses now outsource LLM inference due to high hardware costs, creating concerns about transparency.  Buyers have no way to verify claims about the hardware used, and providers may substitute cheaper hardware or models, defrauding clients. This issue is especially pertinent given concerns about malicious actors deploying models with weaker security or violating geographical location agreements.

This paper introduces Hardware and Software Platform Inference (HSPI), a method to identify the underlying GPU architecture and software stack of an LLM solely based on its input-output behavior.  HSPI leverages subtle differences in how various GPU architectures and compilers perform calculations. The authors propose a classification framework that analyzes numerical patterns in model outputs to accurately identify the GPU and software configuration.  Their results demonstrate the feasibility of inferring GPU type from black-box models, achieving high accuracy in both white-box and black-box tests. The paper also discusses limitations and possible future applications of HSPI.

### In-depth insights


#### Hardware Inference
Hardware inference, in the context of machine learning models, presents a novel approach to verifying the authenticity of cloud-based services.  **It addresses the lack of transparency in the hardware used by LLM providers**, a critical concern as businesses increasingly rely on third-party services. By analyzing the subtle numerical patterns in a model's output, this technique aims to **identify the underlying GPU architecture and software stack**, even without direct access to the model's internal workings. This is accomplished by exploiting the inherent variations in how calculations are executed across different hardware and software environments.  The implications are significant, as it could **deter providers from substituting less expensive hardware** and ensure clients receive the promised computational resources and performance.  **Future research should focus on improving accuracy** and addressing limitations in black-box scenarios, which are critical for practical applications within the rapidly evolving landscape of large language models.

#### HSPI Methodology
A hypothetical "HSPI Methodology" section would delve into the specifics of how Hardware and Software Platform Inference is performed.  It would likely detail the two proposed methods: **HSPI with Border Inputs (HSPI-BI)** and **HSPI with Logits Distributions (HSPI-LD)**.  HSPI-BI would be explained as a technique that uses specifically crafted inputs, or border inputs, to highlight subtle differences in output between various hardware/software configurations.  The process of generating these border inputs, possibly involving iterative methods like Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), would be described.  **HSPI-LD**, conversely, would focus on analyzing the statistical distributions of model output logits (pre-softmax probabilities), looking for characteristic patterns linked to specific hardware and software setups. The methodology would also address the challenges in obtaining necessary data, specifically noting the differences between white-box (full model access) and black-box (only input/output access) scenarios, explaining how the approach adapts to these limitations. Finally, it would discuss the use of machine learning classifiers, such as SVMs, to analyze the collected data and classify the underlying hardware and software platform.

#### Black-Box Limits
The hypothetical section "Black-Box Limits" in a research paper on hardware and software platform inference (HSPI) would explore the inherent challenges in applying HSPI to completely black-box machine learning models.  **The primary limitation is the lack of access to internal model states or parameters.** This contrasts with the white-box setting where complete model architecture and internal workings are known, enabling precise analysis of numerical patterns to identify hardware/software characteristics. In a black-box scenario, **inference is solely based on input-output pairs**, significantly limiting the ability to identify subtle computational variations caused by underlying hardware.  The section would likely discuss the reduced accuracy of HSPI in black-box settings and potential mitigation strategies such as **increased input sampling**, or the use of **advanced statistical techniques** to extract meaningful patterns from limited observations. It might also examine how **model obfuscation techniques** employed by providers could further hinder HSPI's effectiveness, presenting a significant challenge to transparent and accountable AI service delivery.  Furthermore, **the generalizability of findings across diverse models and hardware architectures** would likely be discussed. The practical implications regarding the trade-off between transparency and the black-box nature of many commercial models would also be a key focus of the discussion.

#### Software Effects
Software significantly influences the reproducibility and reliability of machine learning model outputs.  **Variations in compilers, runtimes, and framework implementations create subtle but measurable differences** in numerical results, even when using identical hardware and models. This highlights the critical need for standardized software environments to ensure consistency and comparability across different deployments.  **The software stack's impact is often intertwined with hardware factors**, making it challenging to isolate the influence of each. This highlights the importance of considering both hardware and software when assessing the performance and reliability of AI models.  **Lack of software transparency further hinders reproducibility**, as differing software configurations may lead to different equivalence classes for computational results.  To enhance the trustworthiness of AI systems and improve the governance of ML supply chains, **establishing clear standards for documenting and reporting software components is crucial.**  Such documentation will also facilitate the identification and debugging of reproducibility issues, contributing towards greater transparency and accountability in the broader ML ecosystem.

#### Future of HSPI
The future of Hardware and Software Platform Inference (HSPI) is bright, driven by the increasing demand for transparency and accountability in the machine learning (ML) market.  **Further research should focus on improving the robustness of HSPI against adversarial attacks and improving the accuracy of inference in black-box settings.** This will involve exploring advanced techniques like analyzing more subtle computational patterns and incorporating diverse datasets.  **The development of standardized benchmarks and datasets for evaluating HSPI is crucial.**  **Collaboration between researchers, service providers, and hardware manufacturers will accelerate progress**, fostering the creation of industry-wide standards for supply chain transparency. As the adoption of HSPI grows, we can anticipate its integration into ML governance frameworks, promoting fairness, security, and trust.  **HSPI's applications are not limited to LLMs; its potential extends to other ML models and hardware platforms.** The ultimate goal is to develop a mature and reliable HSPI that effectively ensures the integrity and ethical deployment of ML models globally.  This would help mitigate issues around unfair pricing, security breaches, and unexpected performance differences and boost trust and adoption.

> üîº This figure illustrates how a single-precision 32-bit floating-point number (FP32), representing a logit from a neural network, is converted into three 32-bit integer numbers (INT32).  The process involves separating the logit's sign, exponent, and fractional parts. Each part is then zero-padded to ensure it's a full 32 bits, and each is treated as a separate integer. This is done to address the issue of rounding noise that may be present in FP32 numbers. By separating the components, the impact of this rounding noise on the overall bit distribution is reduced. This pre-processing step is performed before training Support Vector Machines (SVMs), likely to improve the accuracy of the classification task.

> üîº This figure illustrates the process of generating samples for Hardware and Software Platform Inference using Logits Distributions (HSPI-LD) with Large Language Models (LLMs).  The process involves prompting an LLM to produce a sequence of random words.  The model's output includes the generated words and their associated logits (the pre-softmax probabilities of each word). These logits are then flattened into a single vector, which serves as the input data for training a classifier. This classifier is designed to distinguish between different hardware and software configurations based on the unique patterns in the logit distributions.

> üîº This figure shows example border images generated using the HSPI-BI method for MobileNet-v3-Small model. Each image is an input that causes the model to predict different classes when the model is quantized to different numerical precision formats (FP16, INT8, MXINT8, BF16, FP8-E3, FP8-E4).  The format of each image's subcaption indicates the quantization format used and the resulting prediction (e.g., 'FP16: FROG' denotes that when using FP16 quantization, the model predicts 'FROG'). This demonstrates how subtle differences in numerical precision due to quantization can lead to different model outputs, making it possible to infer hardware and software platform information based on the model's input-output behavior.

This results in a total of 50000 logits across all the quantization methods. The purpose of the figure is to visually illustrate the subtle but distinct differences in logit distributions introduced by various quantization techniques, which forms the basis for Hardware and Software Platform Inference (HSPI) in the paper.  The visual comparison shows how these differing distributions can be used to differentiate between various hardware and software configurations.

> üîº This figure shows how the transferability of border images is affected by the batch size used during their training.  Transferability refers to the ability of border images, trained on one model, to successfully distinguish between different hardware/software configurations when applied to other models. The x-axis represents the batch size, and the y-axis represents the transferability accuracy (presumably F1-score). The plot shows an improvement in transferability with increasing batch sizes, up to a certain point after which the improvement plateaus or diminishes.  This suggests that larger batch sizes may help generalize the features of the border images, improving their ability to discriminate across different model setups. However, increasing the batch size beyond a certain point may not yield additional benefits or could even lead to reduced performance.
