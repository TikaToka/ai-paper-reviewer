### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

This paper connects in-context learning (ICL), a machine learning technique where models learn from examples in their input sequence, with Occam's Razor, the principle that simpler explanations are generally better.  It shows that ICL's core objective (minimizing the next-token prediction loss) is the same as minimizing data compression through a technique called prequential coding. This means ICL simultaneously minimizes training error and model complexity, making it a practical application of Occam's Razor.  The researchers confirm this finding empirically. They also find that current ICL methods can underfit and show ways to potentially improve them.

#### Why does it matter?
This research paper explores the connection between Occam's Razor and in-context learning (ICL) in machine learning models.  It demonstrates that ICL's next-token prediction objective is equivalent to prequential coding, a data compression technique.  By minimizing the prequential code length, ICL implicitly minimizes both training error and model complexity, effectively implementing Occam's Razor.  The paper also reveals limitations of current ICL methods and suggests avenues for improvement.

Pseudocode of the prequential coding program, which jointly compresses D and pÎ¸ by incrementally training a model using T on increasingly more data. The primary contribution to total program length comes from specifying each next datapoint di+1 using the current model pÎ¸i, which takes âˆ’log2 pÎ¸i(di+1) bits. b. A visual illustration of prequential coding. As the learner T sees more data, it outputs models that assign a higher likelihood to new observations, and can thus better compress them. The total prequential code length Lpreq(D; T) is given by the area under the curve. The area underneath the curveâ€™s last point is equal to the complexity of the dataset given the final model, K(D|pÎ¸). Since Lpreq(D; T) = K(D|pÎ¸) + K(pÎ¸), the area above the curveâ€™s last point is equal to K(pÎ¸). Prequential coding formalizes the intuition that simple models generalize better from less data.")
