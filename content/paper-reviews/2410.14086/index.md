### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

This paper connects the empirical success of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models with the theoretical principle of Occam's Razor.  It shows that the next-token prediction objective commonly used to train ICL models is mathematically equivalent to a data compression method called prequential coding.  Minimizing this loss means the model is simultaneously minimizing both training error and its complexity. The researchers find that current ICL methods don't fully leverage this, and they suggest potential improvements to existing techniques by directly minimizing the prequential code length. They validate their findings through experiments on various machine learning tasks, showing that their suggested approach leads to better generalization, especially when data is limited.

#### Why does it matter?
This paper is crucial for researchers in machine learning and NLP. It bridges the gap between the practical success of in-context learning and theoretical understandings of generalization, offering a novel perspective on Occam's Razor.  The findings challenge existing ICL methods and suggest improvements, paving the way for more efficient and effective models.

> Figure 1: Illustration of prequential coding, a method for estimating K(D, Î¸) = K(D|pÎ¸) + K(pÎ¸) using Î¸â€™s learning algorithm T. a. Pseudocode of the prequential coding program, which jointly compresses D and pÎ¸ by incrementally training a model using T on increasingly more data. The primary contribution to total program length comes from specifying each next datapoint di+1 using the current model pÎ¸i, which takes âˆ’log2 pÎ¸i(di+1) bits. b. A visual illustration of prequential coding. As the learner T sees more data, it outputs models that assign a higher likelihood to new observations, and can thus better compress them. The total prequential code length Lpreq(D; T) is given by the area under the curve. The area underneath the curveâ€™s last point is equal to the complexity of the dataset given the final model, K(D|pÎ¸). Since Lpreq(D; T) = K(D|pÎ¸) + K(pÎ¸), the area above the curveâ€™s last point is equal to K(pÎ¸). Prequential coding formalizes the intuition that simple models generalize better from less data.
