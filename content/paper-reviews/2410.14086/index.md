### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

This paper investigates the effectiveness of in-context learning (ICL), a technique where models learn during inference from examples in the input. The authors connect ICL to Occam's Razor, the principle that simpler models which explain the data generalize better. They show that ICL's next-token prediction loss is equivalent to a data compression method called prequential coding.  Minimizing this loss means finding models that balance explaining the training data and having low complexity. Experiments demonstrate that ICL indeed prioritizes simpler models, leading to better generalization, especially with limited data. However, the authors also find that current ICL methods are susceptible to underfitting, suggesting avenues for improvement by directly optimizing for simplicity.  In essence, the research provides a theoretical framework linking ICL to Occam's Razor, explains its strengths and weaknesses, and proposes ways to enhance its capabilities.

#### Why does it matter?
This paper is crucial for researchers in machine learning, particularly those working on in-context learning and meta-learning.  It bridges the gap between practical observations of simple models generalizing well and theoretical explanations, offering a novel perspective grounded in Occam's Razor and data compression. The findings challenge existing methods and suggest new directions for improving in-context learning algorithms, directly impacting the development of more efficient and generalizable AI systems.  The connection drawn between ICL and data compression is insightful and opens up many new avenues for research.

> Figure 1: Illustration of prequential coding, a method for estimating K(D, Î¸) = K(D|pÎ¸) + K(pÎ¸) using Î¸â€™s learning algorithm T. a. Pseudocode of the prequential coding program, which jointly compresses D and pÎ¸ by incrementally training a model using T on increasingly more data. The primary contribution to total program length comes from specifying each next datapoint di+1 using the current model pÎ¸i, which takes â€“ log2 pÎ¸i(di+1) bits. b. A visual illustration of prequential coding. As the learner T sees more data, it outputs models that assign a higher likelihood to new observations, and can thus better compress them. The total prequential code length Lpreq(D; T) is given by the area under the curve. The area underneath the curveâ€™s last point is equal to the complexity of the dataset given the final model, K(D|pÎ¸). Since Lpreq(D; T) = K(D|pÎ¸) + K(pÎ¸), the area above the curveâ€™s last point is equal to K(pÎ¸). Prequential coding formalizes the intuition that simple models generalize better from less data.
