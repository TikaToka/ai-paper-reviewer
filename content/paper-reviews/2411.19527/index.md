### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Generating realistic human motion remains challenging.  Discrete methods prioritize faithfulness to input signals but often produce unnatural, noisy movements.  Continuous methods generate smoother motions, but struggle with high dimensionality and limited training data, often lacking faithfulness. This creates a 'discord' between efficiency and realism.

DisCoRD resolves this by decoding discrete motion tokens into continuous motion via rectified flow. This iterative refinement in continuous space captures fine-grained dynamics, producing smoother, more natural motions while maintaining faithfulness to the input signals. Experiments across different tasks show DisCoRD's effectiveness, significantly improving motion naturalness while preserving accuracy. A novel metric, sJPE, is introduced to better capture perceptual naturalness.

> üîº DisCoRD, unlike traditional methods, uses an iterative decoding process in continuous space to generate motion from discrete latent representations. This approach addresses the limitations of deterministic decoding by recovering the inherent continuity and dynamism of motion.  The figure illustrates this process, highlighting how DisCoRD improves upon existing methods by balancing faithfulness and naturalness.  It also introduces a new evaluation metric, Symmetric Jerk Percentage Error (sJPE), which is used in addition to FID to assess the naturalness of generated motion.

> Figure 1: Concept of DisCoRD. Discrete quantization methods encode multiple motions into a single quantized representation. While existing methods deterministically decode from this quantized representation, DisCoRD iteratively decodes the discrete latent in a continuous space to recover the inherent continuity and dynamism of motion. To assess the gap between reconstructed and real motion, prior work primarily used FID as the metric. Here, we additionally propose symmetric Jerk Percentage Error (sJPE) to evaluate the differences in naturalness between reconstructed and real motion.

> üîº Table 1 presents a quantitative comparison of different methods for motion reconstruction using the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets.  The metrics used are Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID), which measures the similarity between the generated and real motion feature distributions, and Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE), which measures the average distance between corresponding joints in the generated and real motions. A novel metric, Symmetric Jerk Percentage Error (sJPE), is also included, assessing the naturalness of the generated motion by evaluating the smoothness of the motion trajectory. The table highlights that DisCoRD, when used as a decoder for discrete motion representations (as opposed to using a continuous method like MLD), achieves superior performance on both FID and sJPE, demonstrating its effectiveness at translating discrete tokens into natural, continuous motions.

### In-depth insights


#### Motion Gen Models
Motion generation models are broadly classified into those using continuous and discrete representations.  **Continuous models** directly regress on continuous motion values, aiming for smooth and natural results. However, they struggle with high dimensionality and limited data, often compromising faithfulness to input signals.  **Discrete models**, utilizing techniques like VQ-VAEs, quantize motions into discrete tokens, enhancing efficiency and faithfulness, but at the cost of reduced expressiveness and potential artifacts like frame-wise noise or under-reconstruction.  DisCoRD innovatively bridges this gap by decoding discrete tokens into continuous motion via rectified flow, achieving a **balance of faithfulness and naturalness** that surpasses both approaches. The iterative refinement process in continuous space is key to capturing fine-grained dynamics, resulting in smoother, more realistic motion. This approach showcases the significant potential of combining the strengths of both continuous and discrete methods for superior human motion generation.

#### Rectified Flow Decode
The concept of "Rectified Flow Decoding" presents a novel approach to enhance the naturalness of motion generation models while preserving faithfulness to input signals.  It leverages the strengths of **discrete tokenization** for efficient representation and **score-based models** for generating continuous and dynamic motion.  The core idea is an iterative refinement process in continuous space, where discrete motion tokens, representing compressed motion information, are decoded iteratively via a rectified flow.  This method contrasts with traditional deterministic decoding, enabling the reconstruction of fine-grained dynamics and smoother, more realistic movements.  **Rectified flow's iterative nature** helps address under-reconstruction and frame-wise noise issues, often associated with discrete methods. The technique's compatibility with existing discrete frameworks offers significant flexibility and broad applicability. The use of **score-based models enhances the stochasticity** of the decoding process, leading to greater variability and naturalness in the generated motion.  Therefore, this approach successfully bridges the gap between the efficiency of discrete representations and the realism of continuous motion generation.

#### sJPE Evaluation
The proposed sJPE (Symmetric Jerk Percentage Error) metric offers a nuanced approach to evaluating the naturalness of generated human motion, addressing shortcomings of traditional metrics like FID and MPJPE.  **sJPE directly assesses the smoothness of motion by analyzing jerk**, the third derivative of position, thus capturing subtle irregularities missed by position-based metrics. By decomposing sJPE into Noise sJPE and Static sJPE, **it differentiates between frame-wise noise and under-reconstruction**, providing granular insights into specific aspects of motion quality.  The strong correlation between sJPE scores and human perception validates its effectiveness in evaluating the realism of generated motion.  This **granular analysis is crucial** because it allows for a more refined understanding of what constitutes natural motion, going beyond simple visual fidelity to capture human-perceptual nuances. The results from sJPE effectively distinguish the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of motion quality when compared to the baseline models.

#### Ablation Study
An ablation study systematically removes components of a model to assess their individual contributions.  In the context of this research, it would involve selectively disabling parts of the DisCoRD model, such as the rectified flow decoder, the projection module, or the iterative refinement process, to understand their impact on the model's performance. The results would help determine which components are essential for achieving high faithfulness and naturalness in motion generation.  **Key insights gained would include identifying critical model elements and understanding the trade-offs between different model components**. For example, removing the iterative refinement step might increase computational efficiency but potentially sacrifice some motion detail or naturalness.  **The study helps to confirm the necessity of each element and assess the overall design choices**. This analysis would ultimately improve the model's efficiency and robustness by pinpointing areas for optimization and highlighting potentially redundant components, leading to a more streamlined and effective model architecture.

#### Future Works
Future work for DisCoRD could involve several exciting directions.  **Extending DisCoRD to handle longer sequences** is crucial for more complex motions.  Current limitations on sequence length need to be addressed.  **Exploring alternative architectures for the rectified flow decoder** could improve efficiency and potentially the quality of generated motion.  **Investigating different score-based models** beyond rectified flow might yield further performance gains and explore a wider range of expressiveness.  **Incorporating more sophisticated conditioning techniques** would increase the model's ability to capture nuanced details from diverse signals.  Finally, **a focus on improving the evaluation metrics** is important to better assess qualitative aspects such as fluidity and realism.  A more comprehensive evaluation framework could further advance the field. The current success of DisCoRD paves the way for a multitude of improvements, promising significant advances in human motion generation.

The left graph shows that Noise sJPE is highly sensitive to small amounts of frame-wise noise, while Static sJPE remains relatively unaffected. This indicates that Noise sJPE is a more effective metric for capturing subtle noise artifacts. The right graph visually compares the generated motions, showcasing the effect of Gaussian noise. It further illustrates how Noise sJPE distinguishes between subtle variations in motion quality more effectively than FID, which is less sensitive to small differences, especially with already low FID scores.

> üîº Figure 12 presents a qualitative comparison of human motion generation results from three different methods: a continuous method (MLD), a discrete method (MoMask), and the proposed DisCoRD approach.  Each row shows motion generated from the same text prompt.  The continuous method (MLD) produces smooth motions but frequently lacks faithfulness to the textual description. The discrete method (MoMask) suffers from under-reconstruction, which leads to simplified or unnatural movements, especially noticeable in the hands and legs, and frame-wise noise, causing jerky or unnatural motion. The DisCoRD method, in contrast, aims to balance the strengths of both approaches, generating motion that remains faithful to the text description while maintaining smoothness and naturalness.

> üîº Table 2 presents a quantitative comparison of different methods for text-to-motion generation on the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets.  The metrics used are Top-K Recall@1, FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance), Multimodal Distance, and Multimodality.  The plus-or-minus symbol (¬±) indicates the 95% confidence interval for each metric's score. Rows with '+DisCoRD' show the performance when the DisCoRD method replaces the original decoder of a baseline model. Bold typeface highlights the best performance for each metric, and underlined text indicates the second-best performance.  The table demonstrates that DisCoRD improves the naturalness of generated motion (lower FID scores), while maintaining its faithfulness to the input text (higher R-Precision and lower Multimodal Distance).

> üîº This ablation study investigates the impact of different architectural choices within the DisCoRD model on its performance.  Specifically, it examines the effect of three key components: the projection method used to transform discrete tokens into continuous features, the inclusion of an attention mechanism in the U-Net architecture, and the training strategy using windowed motion sequences (as opposed to full-length sequences).  The results, evaluated on the HumanML3D dataset, quantify the contribution of each component to the model's reconstruction and generation quality, as measured by FID and MPJPE.

The metrics used include Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID), which measures the realism of generated motions; R-Precision (Top 1, Top 2, Top 3), which evaluates the accuracy of retrieving the correct motion given a text description; MultiModal Distance (MM-Dist), which assesses how well the generated motions align with their textual descriptions; and MultiModality, which measures the diversity of generated motions.  The table includes results for several baseline methods and then shows the improved performance achieved when replacing the baseline decoder with the DisCoRD decoder.  The plus-or-minus values (¬±) indicate the 95% confidence interval around the reported metrics, reflecting the uncertainty in the measurements.  Bold font highlights the best performance for each metric, while underlined font indicates the second-best performance.

The metrics used are FIDk (kinetic features), FIDg (geometric features), and Beat Align Score (BAS). While FIDk and FIDg are known to be unreliable, DisCoRD shows an improvement in the BAS, indicating better synchronization between the generated dance and the music.  This suggests that although some aspects of visual fidelity may not show significant improvement, the method still improves the overall alignment of the motion to the music.
