Instead, I'm selecting precise, vivid words, ensuring the paragraph's structure and meaning are thoughtfully established. This approach keeps the text engaging and grammatically sound. ** Creating compliant content** I'm crafting a 3-sentence paragraph that avoids 'be', 'of', and 'is'. The paragraph will stay clear of mentioning policies or hidden reasoning, ensuring compliance and appropriateness. ** Clarifying usage rules** I'm sorting out which forms of 'to be' are allowed, like 'being' and 'been', while 'be', 'is', 'are', 'was', and 'were' are prohibited. This distinction ensures precision in word choice. **Crafting the scene** I'm thinking about a sentence to paint a vivid picture without using 'of', 'be', or 'is'. The phrase "hues of pink and orange" needs rephrasing to avoid 'of'. **Painting a morning** I'm crafting a vivid morning scene: the sun rises, colors the sky in pink and orange, birds sing, and people enjoy hopeful smiles as the day starts. It's sprucing up each sentence for clarity and appeal.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>>Inference The sun climbs slowly, painting the horizon with vibrant shades that hint at warmth 2 Birds sing in unison, their melody drifting across the quiet streets 3 People stroll along paths, their faces glowing with anticipation for what lies ahead.
