### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Existing code completion benchmarks usually focus on a limited number of languages and lack fine-grained analysis, hindering the evaluation of code LLMs' abilities across different languages and scenarios.  This significantly limits the advancement of multilingual code intelligence. 

To address these issues, this paper introduces M2RC-EVAL, a **massively multilingual repository-level code completion benchmark** covering 18 programming languages. It offers fine-grained annotations (bucket-level and semantic-level) for various completion scenarios, allowing for a more detailed performance analysis.  Furthermore, it introduces M2RC-INSTRUCT, a large-scale multilingual instruction dataset, to improve the performance of code LLMs.

### In-depth insights


#### Multilingual Code Eval
The Multilingual Code Eval section delves into a novel benchmark dataset called **M2RC-EVAL**, designed to assess the multilingual code intelligence capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).  Unlike previous benchmarks limited to a few programming languages, **M2RC-EVAL supports 18 languages**, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs across diverse linguistic contexts.  The dataset incorporates two types of fine-grained annotations: **bucket-level** (based on abstract syntax tree depth) and **semantic-level** (categorizing code semantics), providing a nuanced understanding of LLM performance across various code completion scenarios.  Furthermore,  the authors introduce a companion dataset, **M2RC-INSTRUCT**, a multilingual instruction corpus aimed at enhancing the performance of LLMs in repository-level code completion tasks. The combined M2RC-EVAL and M2RC-INSTRUCT datasets offer a significant advancement for evaluating and improving multilingual code intelligence in LLMs.

#### Fine-Grained Annotation
The heading 'Fine-grained Annotation' details the **two levels of annotations** used to enrich the M2RC-EVAL benchmark: **bucket-level and semantic-level**.  Bucket-level annotation divides the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) into fixed-size buckets, assigning labels based on the node's layer. This provides a nuanced view of completion difficulty across different code structures.  **Semantic-level annotation** focuses on the meaning of the code by assigning pre-defined semantic labels (e.g., Program Structure, Expression) to the code snippets.  This granular approach reveals code LLM performance across various coding scenarios.  The combined annotation strategy, based on parsed ASTs, significantly enhances the evaluation by moving beyond simple average scores to a more detailed analysis of strengths and weaknesses across various programming languages and code complexities.

#### Instruction Corpora
The research paper introduces **M¬≤RC-INSTRUCT**, a new massively multilingual instruction corpora designed to significantly boost the performance of repository-level code completion models.  This dataset, comprising code snippets from 18 programming languages, serves as a valuable training resource for these models.  Its creation involved a rigorous process of data collection, filtering, and annotation, aiming for high-quality and diverse examples.  The emphasis on multilingualism and detailed annotations (including bucket-level and semantic-level labels generated from the abstract syntax tree) allows for granular evaluation of model performance across languages and specific code contexts. **M¬≤RC-INSTRUCT‚Äôs effectiveness is empirically validated** in the paper's experimental results, showcasing the positive impact on various code completion models.  The inclusion of M¬≤RC-INSTRUCT highlights a significant advancement in creating more comprehensive and effective training resources for advanced code generation tasks, which may contribute to future improvements in the field of code intelligence and automated software development.

#### Model Size Analysis
The Model Size Analysis section investigates the performance of different sized models, specifically comparing StarCoder-7B and StarCoder-3B.  **StarCoder-7B consistently outperforms StarCoder-3B under standard conditions**, highlighting the general advantage of larger models. However, a significant finding emerges after fine-tuning both models with the M2RC-INSTRUCT dataset.  **Post fine-tuning, StarCoder-3B surpasses the performance of the non-finetuned StarCoder-7B.** This suggests that M2RC-INSTRUCT's effectiveness lies in boosting the capabilities of smaller models, potentially making them more resource-efficient alternatives for repository-level code completion tasks.  The results underscore the value of high-quality instruction datasets in enhancing the performance of code LLMs, particularly for smaller models which may be more practical for deployment scenarios with limited computational resources.

#### Cross-lingual Transfer
The section on "Cross-lingual Transfer" investigates the model's ability to generalize knowledge acquired from one language to others.  A key experiment fine-tunes the StarCoder-7B model using only Python data, then evaluates its performance across 18 languages within the M¬≤RC-EVAL benchmark.  **The results reveal a surprising level of cross-lingual transfer**,  achieving performance close to that obtained when training with data from all 18 languages. This suggests **a strong inherent proficiency in coding within the base model**, despite limitations in explicit instruction-following. The findings highlight the potential for efficient multilingual code generation, indicating that **pre-training on a single, well-represented language can provide significant transfer learning benefits** for other languages, reducing the need for extensive multilingual training data.  This is particularly important given the scarcity of large, high-quality multilingual code datasets.

> üîº This figure illustrates the process of generating code completion cursor positions and their corresponding fine-grained annotations within the M2RC-EVAL benchmark.  First, the source code is parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Then, a node within the AST is randomly selected to represent the code completion cursor position.  The bucket label is determined by the node's level or depth within the AST's tree structure. Finally, the semantic label is assigned based on the node type identified by the Tree-sitter parser, categorizing the code snippet's function (e.g., declaration, expression, statement, etc.).

> üîº This table presents the performance of three different code large language models (Code Llama-7B, StarCoder-7B, and DeepSeekCoder-6.7B) on the M2RC-Eval benchmark.  The performance is measured using two metrics: Exact Match (EM) and Edit Similarity (ES), both expressed as percentages.  Results are shown for each of the 18 programming languages included in the benchmark, with and without retrieval and retrieval with fine-tuning.

> üîº This table presents the average performance of three different code large language models (StarCoder-3B, StarCoder-7B, and DeepSeekCoder-6.7B) on the M2RC-Eval benchmark.  It shows the exact match (EM) and edit similarity (ES) scores for each model under different conditions: baseline (using only the in-file code), with retrieval (incorporating cross-file contexts), and with retrieval and tuning (fine-tuned on the M2RC-INSTRUCT dataset). This allows for comparison of model performance with and without cross-file context retrieval and the impact of fine-tuning on a large multilingual instruction dataset.

> üîº This table presents a quantitative evaluation of the performance of different code generation models across ten programming languages using the CodeBLEU metric. CodeBLEU offers a more nuanced evaluation than simpler metrics by considering textual, syntactic, and semantic similarities between generated and reference code.  The results help illustrate the models' strengths and weaknesses in generating code in different programming languages.

> üîº This table presents the performance of different code generation models on the M2RC-Eval benchmark.  It shows the average exact match (EM) and edit similarity (ES) scores for each model, across all languages in the benchmark. Different configurations are shown, such as using only the in-file context or adding retrieved cross-file context, and with or without further fine-tuning on the M2RC-Instruct dataset. The table allows for comparison of the performance improvement due to retrieval and fine-tuning, and provides insights into the effectiveness of these techniques for different code models.
