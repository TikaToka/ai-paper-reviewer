### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

This research explores introspection in Large Language Models (LLMs), proposing a novel method to evaluate this capability.  The core idea is that introspective models should predict their own behavior better than other models, even those trained on the introspective model's behavior. Experiments using several LLMs demonstrated that self-prediction accuracy consistently exceeded cross-prediction accuracy, providing evidence for introspection in LLMs.  The study also highlights limitations, showing that introspection is effective only for relatively simple tasks. This work significantly advances our understanding of LLMs' internal workings, with implications for interpretability, honesty, and safety, but also raises ethical concerns about potentially enhanced situational awareness and risk of manipulation.

The green bars represent each model's accuracy in predicting its own hypothetical responses across unseen datasets after finetuning on facts about itself. The blue bars show how well a second model, finetuned on the same facts about the first model, can predict the first model. The results imply that models have privileged access to information about themselves (introspection). Error bars show 95% confidence intervals calculated from the standard error of the mean. Right: Our task for testing self-prediction. A model is asked to predict properties of its behavior on a hypothetical prompt. This self-prediction is evaluated against the model's ground-truth behavior (object-level) on the prompt. The figure shows a single example from one task, but results (Left) average over many examples and many tasks (Figure 3).
