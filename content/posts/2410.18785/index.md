### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

This paper comprehensively evaluates various language model editing methods, finding that they generally cause performance degradation and safety issues, especially when scaling to many edits.  Current methods are only suitable for small-scale updates, motivating further research on more robust and reliable editing techniques.

#### Why does this paper matter?
This paper is important because it provides a comprehensive evaluation of existing language model editing methods, revealing their limitations and potential negative impacts.  This is crucial for guiding future research towards more practical and reliable methods, especially regarding safety and scalability.
#### Key Takeaways

{{< alert "star" >}}
{{< typeit speed=10 lifeLike=true >}} Existing language model editing methods cause inevitable performance deterioration on general benchmarks, even with a small number of edits. {{< /typeit >}}
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert "star" >}}
{{< typeit speed=10 startDelay=1000 lifeLike=true >}} Instruction-tuned models are more robust to editing and larger models are more resistant to edits than smaller models. {{< /typeit >}}
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert "star" >}}
{{< typeit speed=10 startDelay=2000 lifeLike=true >}} The safety of edited language models is significantly weakened, even for those safety-aligned models, with even a small number of edits. {{< /typeit >}}
{{< /alert >}}
