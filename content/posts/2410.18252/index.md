### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

This paper proposes asynchronous off-policy RLHF, separating LLM generation and training to enable concurrent processing.  It demonstrates that Online DPO is robust to off-policy data, allowing for efficient training.  Experiments on LLMs from 410M to 8B parameters show significant speedups (up to 40%) while maintaining performance, highlighting the scalability and efficiency of this approach for training large language models.

#### Why does this paper matter?
This paper is important because it introduces a novel asynchronous off-policy approach to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), significantly accelerating the training process of large language models (LLMs) while maintaining performance. This is a crucial development as the computational cost of RLHF is currently a major bottleneck in LLM development, hindering the creation and refinement of increasingly sophisticated models.  The findings offer valuable insights for researchers aiming to reduce computational expense and improve efficiency in the field of LLM training and alignment.

In practice, generation and training speeds differ so a challenge of asynchronous learning is how best to balance usage and leverage idle compute time to further improve training.")
