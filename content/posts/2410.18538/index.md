### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

SMITE is a novel video segmentation method using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model with a tracking module and low-frequency regularization.  It achieves temporally consistent segmentations with flexible granularity, requiring only a few reference images, and outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets.

#### Why does this paper matter?
SMITE is important because it introduces a novel video segmentation technique that supports flexible granularity and can generalize to unseen videos using only a few reference images. This addresses the limitations of existing methods that require extensive manual annotations or struggle with inconsistent segmentations across video frames.

![](figures/figures_4_0.png "ðŸ”¼ Figure 2: SMITE pipeline. During inference (a), we invert a given video into a noisy latent by iteratively adding noise. We then use an inflated U-Net denoiser (b) along with the trained text embedding as input to denoise the segments. A tracking module ensures that the generated segments are spatially and temporally consistent via spatio-temporal guidance. The video latent zÅ‚ is updated by a tracking energy Etrack (c) that makes the segments temporally consistent and also a low-frequency regularizer (d) Ereg which guides the model towards better spatial consistency.")

![](figures/figures_6_0.png "ðŸ”¼ Figure 4: Segment tracking module ensures that segments are consistent across time. It uses co-tracker to track each point of the object's segment (here it is nose) and then finds point correspondence of this segment (denoted by blue dots) across timesteps. When the tracked point is of a different class (e.g,. face) then it is recovered by using temporal voting. The misclassified pixel is then replaced by the average of the neighbouring pixels of adjacent frames. This results are temporally consistent segments without visible flickers.")

Both GSAM2 and Baseline-I struggle to accurately capture the horseâ€™s mane, and GSAM2 misses one leg (Left), whereas our method yields more precise results. Additionally, both alternative techniques create artifacts around the chin (Right), while SMITE produces a cleaner segmentation.")
