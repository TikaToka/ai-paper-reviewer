| What is the slope of the line containing points (2, -3) and (4, 3)? slope = 3 context A slope that goes from low to high is positive. A slope that goes from high to low is negative. A slope that goes straight across is 0. * ** context ... |
| Question: is slope of the line containing points (2, -3) and (4, 3)? |
| What the Ground Truth: (preference) 3 |
| Dis-preference Prediction1: (Instruction Unfollowing) Do you want to solve it step by step? |
|  |
| Dis-preference Prediction2: (Hallucination) The question can be interpreted as the difference in y-values divided by the difference in X- values. That is, let y1 = -3 and y2 = 3. Then x1 = 2 and x2 = 4. The slope is: = 6 |
