## TLDR;

{{< lead >}}
Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are computationally expensive because images require many tokens. Existing methods for reducing these tokens either lose crucial information or only drop tokens early, impacting performance. PyramidDrop offers a novel solution: it strategically drops a portion of image tokens at the end of each stage of the LVLM, starting with a smaller portion in early stages and progressively increasing in later stages. This leverages the observation that visual token redundancy increases as the model processes deeper layers.

This simple yet effective approach significantly accelerates both training and inference. Experiments demonstrate up to a 40% reduction in training time and a 55% reduction in inference FLOPs for LLaVA-NeXT, achieving comparable or even better performance than original models. PyramidDrop can also be used as a plug-and-play inference acceleration technique, outperforming other methods. The results suggest that not all visual tokens are equally important in all layers of the model, providing valuable insights for future LVLMs.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable progress in various applications, but their computational costs are a significant challenge.  Images, as information-rich inputs, are often represented using hundreds or even thousands of tokens in current LVLMs. This leads to quadratically increasing computational costs with higher image resolutions, impacting both training and inference efficiency. Previous methods tried reducing image tokens either before or within early LVLM layers, but this resulted in information loss and diminished performance. The introduction highlights the need for new approaches to address the efficiency challenges posed by the high dimensionality of image data in LVLMs, setting the stage for the proposed PyramidDrop method.

### {{< icon "wand-magic-sparkles" >}} **Key Points**
- The computational cost of LVLMs grows quadratically with image resolution.
- Current methods for reducing image tokens often lead to information loss and reduced performance.
- Images, despite being rich in information, exhibit substantial spatial redundancy.
- The need for efficient training and inference of LVLMs is highlighted as a critical problem in the field of deep learning research.
- The introduction sets the stage for the proposed PyramidDrop method which aims to address the aforementioned challenges of efficiency and information loss associated with large vision-language models.
