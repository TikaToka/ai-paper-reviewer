### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

ZIP-FIT is a novel data selection method that uses gzip compression to efficiently select task-relevant data for fine-tuning LLMs.  It outperforms existing methods by achieving faster convergence and lower cross-entropy loss, demonstrating the importance of data quality and task alignment for efficient LLM training.

#### Why does this paper matter?
This paper introduces ZIP-FIT, a novel data selection method for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). ZIP-FIT leverages gzip compression to measure the alignment between potential training data and the target task distribution, enabling more efficient selection of task-relevant data.  Experiments on Autoformalization and code generation demonstrate that ZIP-FIT significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving faster convergence and lower cross-entropy loss, even with smaller datasets. The findings highlight the importance of data quality and task alignment for efficient LLM fine-tuning.
