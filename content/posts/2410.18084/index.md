### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

DynamicCity is a new framework for generating large-scale, high-quality 4D LiDAR scenes from dynamic scenes. It uses a VAE to learn a compact 4D representation (HexPlane) and a DiT-based diffusion model to generate the HexPlane, supporting various conditional generation applications.  It outperforms existing methods in generation quality, training speed, and memory usage.
